 I was sitting, I had a hard time. Felt a lot of discomfort and 
impatience. You started out by talking about self-knowing. I was aware 
of that, of those qualities, like impatience and discomfort, but it 
didn’t feel to me like self-knowing. And I was just annoyed. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">Yeah.
 Okay let's back up. Please go more slowly because you've already said a
 lot. First of all, you don't like it, is what comes across. You don't 
like being… Of course, who does? You don't like being restless. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Questioner">Questioner:</span> <span class="content">Right. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">Yeah.
 And you say, “I was aware of that.” Sounds good, but I don't know what 
you mean. You see because. No, no… slow down. What I mean is we all use 
words like mindfulness and awareness but what actually is going on - is 
there a sustained, non-judgmental attentiveness to it? See if there 
isn't, people will often say, “Well, I know that. I know that.” But it 
doesn't go away. First of all, part of why it doesn't go away is because
 you are invested in making it go away, and so you're not fully with it.
 </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">I'm
 answering your question beyond your question because it's a good 
question. We're in a hurry to solve problems. Be patient. Struggle with 
your… I know you're enthusiastic. It's good. I won't take too long. 
Often what happens is if something comes up and we experience it as a 
problem, we've had a lot of practice solving problems. And because we 
want to solve the problem, we never get to see what the problem is. And 
so, the awareness that I'm talking about, little by little, gets refined
 so that it's the seeing that has no investment in it. It's not seeing 
in order to get something out of it. It's just a sustained, 
non-judgmental, there's no thinking in it, attentiveness to what's going
 on. Now. Period. Now, how do you see that? </span></li><li><span class="speaker Questioner">Questioner:</span> <span class="content">Well,
 I understand in that it's not seeing so that I can make it go away. 
It's just to be with it. And even if it persists it's not trying to make
 it stop because it's uncomfortable. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">Right. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Questioner">Questioner:</span> <span class="content">It's just seeing it for what it is. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">Right. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Questioner">Questioner:</span> <span class="content">I
 know in the moment when it was happening it didn't feel like 
self-knowing because I was taking it out on… it felt really crowded in 
here, it’s hot. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">You
 know, but you see… self-knowing would be: how do you relate to feeling 
crowded and hot? The person next to you feels crowded and hot, and it's 
fine, piece of cake. And you’re, “Rrrr.. Why should they… They should 
only let 50 people in here.” So self-knowing is beginning, it’s an 
ongoing... Do you see what I'm getting at? </span></li><li><span class="speaker Questioner">Questioner:</span> <span class="content">Right. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">So,
 it's not like, “well, this isn't self-knowing.” I don't want to get 
into semantics, but you can learn something about how you dealt with 
restlessness, how you dealt with, because restlessness comes and hot and
 crowded comes up outside of 331 Broadway. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Questioner">Questioner:</span> <span class="content">Right. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">And
 as you begin to see how you… that's what I meant relationship as the 
teacher: your relationship to being crowded, your relationship to 
feeling hot. Do you see what I'm getting at? </span></li><li><span class="speaker Questioner">Questioner:</span> <span class="content">Yeah </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">That's all. Is that okay? </span></li><li><span class="speaker Questioner">Questioner:</span> <span class="content">Yep. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">Ooh.

 a beginner, I often find that it's hard for me to really be mindful in 
this non-thinking way that you're…you know, if I'm experiencing 
something I sort of recognize that using thoughts rather than using this
 kind of thoughtless mindfulness that I'll hopefully get better at over 
time. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">You're
 not sure. Doubt. You have to see the mind, self-knowing would be like, 
“I'm not sure. He keeps saying that as if it's automatic. It just grows,
 comes with the territory. Just show up, come on Wednesday nights, do a 
retreat now and then, maybe go to IMS, and then one day I'll just be 
just like him seeing everything ready. So, you see doubt there. Sounds 
like you have some doubts. Do you? </span></li><li><span class="speaker Questioner">Questioner:</span> <span class="content">Sure. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">Okay. That's normal. It's not unique to you. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Questioner">Questioner:</span> <span class="content">I
 don’t feel like I’m sinning my doubting or anything. What's your advice
 about working…since thought seems to be the only tool I have right now 
for self-awareness. Not the only tool because occasionally I think I'm 
mindful for a millisecond or something. What's your advice about using 
thoughts? So, if I'm meditating and thinking about myself, do I stay 
with that thought and be thoughtful about myself? Should it be, “Oh, 
back to the breath. Like, that's a thought and so let it go.” I'm sure 
there's a transition over time to something else. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">Okay,
 if you're sure, then I don't have to answer. First of all, let's be 
clear what mindfulness is. There's no thinking in mindfulness. 
Otherwise, it's not what we're talking about. Now, you can be mindful of
 something, and thoughts are going on but they're not in any way 
hampering the clear seeing. So, it's not like you have to stamp out 
thought, but the thoughts don't have that compelling quality. Now with 
practice, especially as you start knowing the difference between 
thinking and everything else. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">See,
 right now, the mind to begin with is quite confused because… one very 
important chapter of self-knowledge has to do with understanding the 
role of thought in life, and to see how limited it is. That in its 
proper place, it's magnificent. But we have equated it with living 
itself. We have given a tremendous authority, probably many if not most 
of us–for all I know, everyone in this room–makes a living from thought.
 You're probably good at it in some realm. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">Okay,
 it's not to stop that but all spiritual life, the real religious 
mind–this is not particularly Buddhist, but the Buddha is very perhaps 
unique–I don't know enough about all the religions–to leave a clear 
roadmap and clear methods to do it. The religious mind is to go beyond 
all this. In other words, that's the immeasurable that I mentioned 
earlier on. Now, all you can do is if I tell you something I don't think
 it's very helpful. All you can do is begin to pay attention to how you 
live. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">Now,
 there is a form of insight that's kind of still helpful and it's not 
just for beginners. It's called reflective insight. And that's where 
seeing and reason and logic and intelligence, putting two and two 
together, is useful. And then there's direct insight. The direct insight
 is uncommon. Probably you don't have that unless you learn how to do 
it. And that's why we're here. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">The
 reflective insight, probably everyone in this room already knows how to
 use it, and it can be refined where you get a sense of things. Let's 
say you see the World Trade Center, the towers go down. From that point 
on many people have a deeper understanding of the impermanent nature of 
life. And it's mixed with thought. Some people, let's say if you see it 
and it goes so deeply into the heart that it goes well beyond the World 
Trade Center, when you start to realize even without the World Trade 
Center, it's always been like that. Everything is impermanent and 
doesn't have an enduring core. It's empty of an autonomous self. So 
there are different levels of depth of insight. The deepest comes from a
 seeing that has nothing to do with previous accumulations, meaning 
thinking, knowledge, and so forth. That doesn't mean it's worthless. And
 on the way what you're saying is useful too. Sure. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">But
 practice mindfulness as best you can. Use it in simple ways. It's not 
finally about the breath. The breath is there to help you be mindful. 
It's about being mindful about what's going on. Take simple activities 
like the dishes, and make it a meditation. You're washing the dishes and
 notice the mind. And then you just gently come back. Just gently come 
back, and just do the dishes. And let that extend out to more 
complicated matters which are, of course, more difficult. And the 
snowball thing is more complicated because there's a threat involved. 
And we know what teenagers are capable of now and who knows what it 
could lead to. But you have to start where you are. Otherwise, it would 
be an impersonation. But what you're doing is not a waste of time. Not 
at all. Yeah, please. </span></li></ul></div><span></span></div><div class="answer true-group-size"><div class="answer-container"><div class="title-display"><h2>How do I practice when overwhelmed by fear? </h2><p class="bold">Lecture: Self Knowing - A Quiet Passion (3) </p><p>Wednesday, Dec 12, 2001</p><p>Question plays from 1:38:11 to 1:41:59</p></div><div class="full-control"><div></div><button class="button"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M424.4 214.7L72.4 6.6C43.8-10.3 0 6.1 0 47.9V464c0 37.5 40.7 60.1 72.4 41.3l352-208c31.4-18.5 31.5-64.1 0-82.6z"></path></svg></button><div class="seek"><span class="slider-container"><input type="range" min="0" max="0" step=".01" value="0"></span></div></div><ul class=" true individual-view lecture-content"><li><span class="speaker Questioner">Questioner:</span> <span class="content">I guess what I fear when fear comes up is that when I pay attention to it, it’s just going to overwhelm me. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">That's an idea. Isn't it? But it's a very convincing one. You believe in it. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Questioner">Questioner:</span> <span class="content">But I’ve often found that it’s overwhelming. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">But
 who makes overwhelming? How do you cut out of the cycle of me? Firstly 
you've concluded that's overwhelming and then you find it, “Well, I was 
right. It is.” It's a one woman show. You're playing all the roles. You 
see what I'm getting at? That's what we're all doing. It's Marcel 
Marceau. You know? If you don't know… you're doing a whole thing. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">But
 now, I'm not trying to force your head into the fear. You get into that
 fear and you look at it, if you're a yogi. I’m not saying that. You can
 be gentle, but it does take a certain courage at the beginning and an 
incentive, an interest in wanting to really understand this so you can 
be free of fear or at least weaken it. I've seen people with horrible 
panic attacks, horrible, learn how to disarm them. And they're not doing
 it…It's the same old, boring Vipassana technique. Nothing new. It's 
just that what you're being asked to be mindful of is not something you 
want to be mindful of. And it's a rough one, but it too can be learned. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">So
 let's reenact it. “Oh my God, this is overwhelming.” Start right there.
 Forget about fear. Just realize that you've already concluded that this
 is hopeless. And, it may be so big that right now your awareness isn't 
ready for it. There may be an element of truth in what you're saying. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">And
 so that's why the samatha or concentration practice is also so 
important. Do you know what I mean by that? Okay. Have you worked with 
the breath in an exclusive way? That concentrates the mind and that 
makes the mind more fit, strong, steady. It needn’t be the breath. It 
can be mantra. There are many, many ways. But you take one thing and you
 come back to it again and again and again. Okay. Out of that, the mind 
starts becoming more steady. And so then, you won't be as likely to feel
 overwhelmed because probably it's true. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">Your
 mindfulness is a baby mindfulness. You haven't done so much of it and 
certainly not with fear. And so it is easily overwhelmed. So, it's both 
in a way. That is, you start little by little approaching it and seeing 
that maybe it's workable. But also, see, every time you're mindful, 
that's what gets stronger not just on the cushion. You mindfully do the 
dishes. You're taking a walk into the square and you're aware of the 
experience of moving. Every time you mindfully hear a bird chirp, the 
car stops because it's a red light, and you're with three or four 
breaths until the light becomes green and you drive. All of that 
contributes to refashioning and reshaping the mind so that it is able to
 do the things that I'm talking about. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">It's
 not like you walk in here, you hear this rap, and then like, far out 
man and you just do it. This is not a quick fix. This practice is for 
adults. What the Buddha is saying is you're responsible for your own 
happiness. And we are being given the tools both in terms of teachings 
and also techniques to enable the mind to be up to the task of looking 
at itself. Because to begin with it probably isn't. One last one please.
 Sure. </span></li></ul></div><span></span></div><div class="answer true-group-size"><div class="answer-container"><div class="title-display"><h2>How can I use self-reliance when there’s little outside support or sangha?

 what the changes are.” And then when lunch came, I felt like that had 
changed and that awareness I had in the morning wasn't necessarily 
something that was going to carry through. Unfortunately, there wasn't 
any dairy at lunch. When tea time came I thought that this had changed, 
that was so. And so I allowed myself to have the tea that had milk in

 don’t have a question, I have… more and more frequently, I’ve been 
noticing why I do something that I do. Even if it’s driving a car and 
letting someone in front of me, and they don’t say “thank you” or wave, 
you know, noticing that that's what I expected from them. And even 
things like smiling or saying…expecting a smile in return and noticing, I
 mean, you're still expecting something in return. But if you notice it,
 you can catch it yourself and that can help. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">Yes
 exactly. Now you're bringing wisdom, Vipassana into it. See, let's say 
you all heard this talk, and it's very convincing. Okay. Yes, we're all 
going to practice dana paramita from the moment we wake up until we go 
to sleep. But we won't be able to because what happens is these old 
impulses reinstate themselves and color everything. So it's not that we 
have to be perfect. What we can do though is we can begin to learn from 
our actual reactions. And that's why the force of generosity is called a
 purification of mind. Any moment that you practice this, you're 
reconditioning your mind in a beneficial way. When you practice greed, 
then you're making that stronger. Hoarding, you're strengthening that. 
Just even a moment, even a thought about it. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">For
 example, just to reflect–and this is a reflection in Buddhist 
practice–people will sometimes go on retreats and take some time, some 
Tibetan practices are like this, where you reflect on past occasions 
when you were generous. It's not to kind of pat yourself on the back and
 build up your ego. It's just to acknowledge how joyful it was to be 
generous, how you enjoyed: Your friends came over, and you have this 
meal in the refrigerator, but, okay, let's share it. And you had a great
 time. So you reflect on past moments when you were generous, and you 
allow yourself to re-experience the generosity. And the deeper your 
samadhi or concentration, you mix your samadhi in with that 
recollection. What you do is, in those mind moments, you're now giving 
yourself the inner feeling of the joy of generosity, which then makes it
 easier for actual generosity in the now to be forthcoming. So what 
you're doing is a good practice. Sure. Please. </span></li></ul></div><span></span></div><div class="answer true-group-size"><div class="answer-container"><div class="title-display"><h2>How do I face the challenges of both giving (dana) and receiving? </h2><p class="bold">Lecture: Dana: The Flowering Of Generosity </p><p>Wednesday, Apr 19, 1989</p><p>Question plays from 1:23:38 to 1:30:13</p></div><div class="full-control"><div></div><button class="button"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M424.4 214.7L72.4 6.6C43.8-10.3 0 6.1 0 47.9V464c0 37.5 40.7 60.1 72.4 41.3l352-208c31.4-18.5 31.5-64.1 0-82.6z"></path></svg></button><div class="seek"><span class="slider-container"><input type="range" min="0" max="0" step=".01" value="0"></span></div></div><ul class=" true individual-view lecture-content"><li><span class="speaker Questioner">Questioner:</span> <span class="content">Recently,
 I’ve been challenged by instances of being able to receive as well as 
being able to give. That’s another issue in itself, I think. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">It's
 the same thing, if I hear you correctly or understand you. For some 
people, receiving is giving. That is if you don't allow–I don't know if 
it'll be funny now, but you know who The Lone Ranger is? Okay, it's not 
important. I'll explain who he is. He was my childhood hero. When I was 
growing up, there was a man: he had a white horse, and he wore a mask, 
and he had a cowboy outfit, and he had an assistant who was an Indian. 
What? </span></li><li><span class="speaker Questioner">Questioner:</span> <span class="content">It was a man on TV. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">This
 was radio, honey. Okay, so this man was The Lone Ranger. And The Lone 
Ranger would constantly be doing good things. You know, he would just 
save this person and donate this. But when people wanted to thank him, 
he would always ride off. And they would say, “Who was that? He's gone.”
 And finally, one of the episodes I remember, and it just struck me as 
hilarious, where people got really furious with him. You know, just sort
 of like, “You're always riding off. You never let us thank you.” Later 
on, Lenny Bruce who was a comedian, made an extended, very good thing 
out of that. And so, in some way, he's not allowing the people who he's 
helped to express their appreciation. And this is a common thing, let's 
say in relationship, where sometimes the way to give someone something 
is to allow to receive. Is that what you're getting at? Yeah. That's 
why, finally, it's a subjective thing. It has to do with the inner 
meaning for you. It's not out there. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Questioner">Questioner:</span> <span class="content">There’s
 another aspect to it. Different people keep talking about material 
objects. Sometimes, you sense the intention that they give. But also 
there is this embedded thing about possessing things. You are actually 
giving it away, so they’re conscious of that too. There’s always fear of
 “Am I going to get something back?” Maybe they might not even be aware 
of it, but giving is so powerful that they give it. Somehow, I tend to 
understand these things, and then you have to deal with the person’s 
psychology–pushing them or something. The energy they give. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">What is it you’re pushing in them? </span></li><li><span class="speaker Questioner">Questioner:</span> <span class="content">Giving is done from the heart. But there is a subconscious period, maybe lasts for two seconds or three seconds… </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">On whose part? The donor or the recipient? </span></li><li><span class="speaker Questioner">Questioner:</span> <span class="content">Both, I guess. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">Okay.
 Yeah we're not perfect yet. And so whatever it is, it's all right. It's
 moving in the right direction. This seems to be an evening for Samu 
Sunim stories. A number of us started a center in New York City. And at 
the opening of it, many Korean people came, really a lot. And they 
brought flowers for the altar which is a custom in Buddhist for Buddhist
 temples to signify impermanence. Flowers wilt and die. They're 
beautiful, you appreciate them, and then they die. It's a teaching. And 
these Korean people brought plastic flowers on the altar. And there were
 a number of us. I remember one person in particular who had very strong
 sense of aesthetics. He was a poet. He's now a very famous poet. And, 
when no one was looking, we'd whisk them away and hide them under the 
clothes. And then these Korean women would find them and just put them 
back out again or there would be more brought. And we did it a few times
 and finally we went to Samu Sunim. “Samu Sunim, we have this beautiful 
new temple and they keep putting all these plastic flowers,” and we were
 complaining. And he says, “These women have very pure hearts.” He said,
 “Your mind is made of plastic.” </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">Many
 of the monks, part of their job is–especially the very mature ones–part
 of their job is to provide people with an object who receives things, 
but they don't need anything. For example, it's quite common…I'm just 
thinking about, our time is running out. Ajahn Chah, who some of you 
have read, you've read his book. So there was an American Monk who had 
an interest in art and he saw all these wonderful works of art being 
donated to Ajahn Chah and being brought to his little meditation hut. 
And at one point it became his turn to clean up Ajahn Chah's hut, and he
 was very excited because he wanted to see all this great art. He came 
into the hut; it was totally empty. All that was there was a cot and 
mosquito netting and totally empty. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">The
 same with Maha Bua. Maha Bua is one of my teachers. He's given things. 
It's like a department store after some of the piles of, you name it, 
and you go into his “kuti” or his little house and all I saw was a jar 
of medicine and a map and a cot and mosquito netting. So apparently 
what's happening is people are giving them. “Thank you very much.” They 
give it to someone else. People give them money. “Thank you very much.” </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">So
 they're a medium, a means for the person to practice on, to develop 
generosity. But they don't need it. It would be stupid for them to just 
pile it up when they don't use it. So they then just recycle it just as 
with the extra food. Okay maybe one last one and then call it an 
evening, if there is anything on anyone's mind. Sure. </span></li></ul></div><span></span></div><div class="answer true-group-size"><div class="answer-container"><div class="title-display"><h2>How do softness and strength naturally arise from tasting our true nature? </h2><p class="bold">Lecture: Self Knowing - A Quiet Passion (2) </p><p>Wednesday, Nov 21, 2001</p><p>Question plays from 1:11:18 to 1:16:52</p></div><div class="full-control"><div></div><button class="button"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 448 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M424.4 214.7L72.4 6.6C43.8-10.3 0 6.1 0 47.9V464c0 37.5 40.7 60.1 72.4 41.3l352-208c31.4-18.5 31.5-64.1 0-82.6z"></path></svg></button><div class="seek"><span class="slider-container"><input type="range" min="0" max="0" step=".01" value="0"></span></div></div><ul class=" true individual-view lecture-content"><li><span class="speaker Questioner">Questioner:</span> <span class="content">You

 not that from that softness comes the strength. The words are going to 
be inadequate because this is inconceivable. The whole point of this 
place is the thinking mind is not there. So you can use words like: the 
silent mind, the cognizing power. These are different words that people 
use. But experientially, I'll do my best. Because it also can sound 
like, there's no news. You don't give a damn about the other people in 
the world. It doesn't mean that at all. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">What
 I can tell you, what little I know of it, is that when it's tapped, 
there's no you there. You is not allowed. No ego is allowed. You can't 
get it… because as long as you're trying to… by definition the big noise
 maker is me. This is a place of spaciousness and silence. Now when we 
hear words like that, then it sounds like it's just a break. It's 
extraordinarily rich. My words are going to be inadequate. But, when you
 tap it, even for a little while, some of how you know what it is is 
afterwards. First of all, it's very fulfilling to be there. There's no 
confusion about that. You can feel that you've entered a dimension. It's
 not a place, it's not here. You've entered a dimension which is a 
dimension that has been unknown to you. It's totally new. And it seems 
to have a certain intelligence there. It's not rational or logical. Let 
me skip ahead. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">You
 find yourself being much more loving and compassionate and wise for 
having tapped this place. Not because you've cultivated… look, take 
metta, loving kindness. Do you know that practice? Okay. For those of 
you who are new, we do a practice here where you cultivate kindness. 
“May I be happy. May I be peaceful.” And then you send it to other 
people. You're trying to develop a certain quality. Maybe you feel you 
don't have enough love. And you can do it with compassion, et cetera. 
That's cultivated. That is you trying to improve you. Okay. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">When
 you tap this place, the compassion is intrinsic. That's magical. At 
this point, I definitely joined the mystics. I have no idea what's going
 on. Whether you want to call it God or awakening or original nature or 
true nature–there are endless words for it–the holy spirit. I don't know
 what to call it, but it's not vague. And you're not cheated. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">Now,
 when you taste that, even for a little while, whatever suffering is out
 there, you see it. When the mind is quiet, the heart can hear. It’s not
 just with these things. You see much more deeply the suffering. And, at
 first, that can be a problem. But the practice can also… the strength 
you're asking about, isn't this kind of strength. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">See
 these images, we're taking worldly images, inner riches. What does that
 mean? That we have gold piled up inside? Inner strength. I have to use 
something that we respect that's out here to kind of help us grasp that 
we have a treasure house in here. But even the word treasure house. 
Okay, it's a jewel. Then we go… So no matter what I say, but the 
strength is that this place is safe from everything. It doesn't arise 
and pass away. It's not vulnerable, but it's not stone. I give up. Yeah.
 </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">But
 let's put it this way. You will feel like you're a more stable person. 
You'll feel like, in the midst of pain that's going around with 
everyone, that you have some strength. There's something stronger than 
the event. But you're not obdurate. You're not hardened or callous to 
the event. You're open to the event. You're sensitive to it. Sensitive, 
discerning. But you're not overrun by that sensitivity. Sensitive, 
vulnerable. That’s the best I can do. Sorry. Yes. </span></li></ul></div><span></span></div><div class="answer true-group-size"><div class="answer-container"><div class="title-display"><h2>How do we engage impermanence with joy?

 been hearing a lot of things about impermanence, and I try to think 
about it when things don't turn out to be the way I expect it to be. But
 sometimes when I try to be happy I also think of impermanence, and I 
know it's not going to be there with me all the time. So I don't 
understand how you can be happy if you think about impermanence. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Larry">Larry:</span> <span class="content">But
 I'm not saying think about impermanence. See, if I can tell you from 
the point of view of this practice. I mean, you know, I learned my stuff
 in Thailand. So who am I to tell you anything? It's in your blood. You 
could tell me a thing or two, I'm sure. There are two kinds of insights;
 I mentioned them. One is reflective, that's a skillful use of thought. 
And the other is direct seeing. So you know that things are impermanent.
 And sometimes in a way we talk to ourselves sort of like, “Oh of 
course, this had a change,” and it helps ease things. Okay. But then 
it's not like what is being suggested here is we go around keep thinking
 “impermanent, impermanent.” But you can learn that when happiness is 
there, you can enjoy it. And then when it's gone, it's gone. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">Let
 me take a very simple example: sunset. Let's say there’s a beautiful 
sunset. No one's saying you can't enjoy it. You're there, and it's just 
beautiful. So much in nature is, especially if the mind is clear. And 
you're appreciating the sunset and it goes down. Your heart is all warm,
 and it's beautiful. No suffering. Then the next day, you come running 
back to get it again. And it isn't the way it was. Or you start 
comparing it, “in Acapulco was better than…” The first was joy. One way 
to talk about it was joy. The second was a quest for pleasure, where we 
try to get it. Now if you can allow yourself to be happy when it's 
there, knowing that of course it's not going to last forever. And while 
you're happy, you're happy. It's just a fact. And then it's gone. And 
then what's next is what's next. </span></li><li><span class="speaker Break_line">Break_line:</span> <span class="content">Now
 there's a deeper place than happiness, unhappiness, happiness unhappy. 
And that's what Rumi's point. There's a place that isn't. The happiness 
you're talking about is subject to vicissitude. Change. Coming and 
going, rising and falling, praise and blame, healthy and sick, all those
 kind of things. If you can get comfortable with it, be with it, let it 
go. Be with it, let it go. It takes you to someplace; you could call it 
“true happiness,” that's deeper than whether you have good fortune or 
bad fortune. Good fortune must alternate with bad fortune. Good health 
and bad health, praise and blame, wealth and poverty, strength and 
weakness, all of those. If you don't believe me, check your life. Is 
there any of those qualities? You have them forever? I don't think so. 
But we're talking about something that never… anything that arises 
passes away. What the Buddhist saying is something that never was born, 
so it can't die. Okay, so it's not that you shouldn't be happy. But when
 you're happy, enjoy the happiness. And when it's gone, just know the 
truth of that, and be with what's next. That's the practice. Does that 
make sense? Okay, one more and then really we should… please. </span></li></ul></div><span></span></div></div></div></div></div></body><grammarly-desktop-integration data-grammarly-shadow-root="true"></grammarly-desktop-integration></html>
