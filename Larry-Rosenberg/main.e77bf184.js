","What do I do about energetically sucking relationships? "],end_time:"00:40:44",content:["Larry: Let\u2019s just sample a few other things that are central and that can be really interesting for you, beginning with right now. I mean even when you leave, you\u2019re not this moment. A lot of what is the foundation of meditation has to do with learning about and taking care of the body, learning about speech, and then of course the mind itself. ","Break_line: Let's take speech. When the teacher that I mentioned whose name was Krishnamurti said, \u201cpay attention as to how you actually live,\u201d the part that was most difficult for me was to pay attention as to how I use these two lips. When I would create a friction, engineered some friction and words would come out, it was sometimes very painful to hear what was coming out of my mouth. If you pay attention\u2013you have to really listen\u2013with an open mind, with a mind that's just the famous beginner's mind. I don't know. Just really, \u201chow do I do talking?\u201d And that includes not talking, silence. ","Break_line: Sometimes we've used this at the center since the beginning as a practice for people. Sometimes people are very shy, so called introverted. As they pay attention to this realm of communication, they see that they have things to say, and they don't say it, and that it's painful for them. And that little by little they start to speak more. And then blabber mouths like myself we get quieter. It might be hard for you to believe that because if you see me only on Wednesday nights, there is life for me outside of Wednesday night where I can be quite quiet and happily so. ","Break_line: So, right speech as you start to pay attention as to how you actually live is another fundamental area of human life that helps put a foundation in for the so-called higher things. And in that, what tends to happen as you pay attention is your speech becomes more accurate and more precise. More and more, you say what you mean and you mean what you say. And the gaps between what you say and the motives that you have and the gaps between what you say and your actions start to narrow down. And when they don't, you see it. That's part of self-knowledge is getting on to yourself. ","Break_line: It's an extraordinary journey, and it's not easy because what you're doing is you're seeing this self unfold. And what's being said is learning how to live and self-knowledge are really the same thing. The degree to which we don't understand ourselves no matter what that is, each person\u2013there's no standard here\u2013you have to understand yourself, me myself. The degree to which you don't understand yourself is probably the degree to which you're suffering unnecessarily. ","Break_line: Ajahn Chah, who's a teacher, whoop, I'm quoting someone else, who wants to pinch me? I\u2019ll pinch me. Let's forget about that one. Who cares what Ajahn Chah said? Now I have to say it. But I forgot because I'm so in the moment. When you start paying attention to speech and you begin to see what comes out of your mouth, just hear it in an open way, not only does that reveal a lot to you about yourself but also you start to learn about listening because you can't do speech. Speech won't get refined unless you learn how to listen. In fact, it's only if you start paying attention to speech and listening that you learn the art of listening not only to yourself but to others. And so, this art of paying attention as to how you live, how you actually live from moment to moment. ","Break_line: And what Ajahn Chah often said was that you can use all the techniques and do all the retreats that you want. Finally it's going to come down to, however you got there: Do you understand yourself? To what degree? Or don't you? If you don't you're still going to be suffering a lot because actions are going to come out of you that are not beneficial for you or for others in your life. ","Break_line: And as you come self-knowing\u2013and that's why it's so precious\u2013that's what's really lacking on planet Earth. It's not an energy crisis. It's an understanding crisis. We don't understand ourselves. And writ large the human race does not understand how to live on this potentially beautiful planet. Okay but I'm not getting Utopian. Each one of us, we have a life to live. And these are just a few hints of the ongoing way. ","Break_line: And then of course it starts with just one memory that I had, just came to me, a teacher that I had in Thailand some years ago. \u201cRegarding right speech,\u201d he said \u201cwhat will help you most of all is when you start to tap silence in your mind.\u201d And I was puzzled by that. \u201cWhy while when my mind becomes silent will my ability to understand my speech develop?\u201d He said, \u201cwhen your mind becomes silent you start to be able to really hear what you're saying. And if it's, let's say like a discordant note, if you're a musician, or you know chalk on the blackboard that screeches, it's painful when you hear yourself saying something that's BS. Do you know what I mean? Exaggerated, not true, designed to form an impression. And it does and people like it. And then somehow it leaves a residue that is a little unsatisfying in us. If you start to pay attention. If you don't, roll on, just go on your merry way of saying things that aren't true, that make you feel good. Okay, so, it's a substantial activity. And it's not just psychological because in the seeing of it there's a letting go of all kinds of attachments; otherwise it won't happen. And, again, it takes us to clear mind.

And in this particular approach, in Vipassana and the Therav\u0101din tradition, I don't think it's different than the other Buddhist schools that I've trained in, but I don't know them as well. I've suggested becoming more familiar with the body, just how to take care of the body. ","Break_line: Now, to back up a bit, Buddhist wisdom is needed there as well. The wisdom of the Buddha is very, very important there because you can get so good at caring for the body. And in this age many of us are. There's just a lot of information and encouragement now to eat properly, to exercise, to do the very things I just said. And science is, there's some staggering breakthroughs. Herbal medicine, which I know a little bit about, is bringing together high tech with folk medicine, so called thousands of years of herbal wisdom and laboratory techniques of extraction that enable herbs to be so pure and effective beyond what the ancients could do. And now yoga even made it to Newsweek or Time magazine? Someone a while back, someone in some exotic posture. ","Break_line: And so you can get so good at being healthy that you look younger, have more energy, are more attractive, and get compliments. And when you have more energy, you have more energy for more mischief. And if you're trying to bring the body into some reasonable condition\u2013I'm not saying become obsessed with it\u2013in order to provide the basis for deep seeing and the development of liberating wisdom. And in the process, you get sidetracked into having a body that you want to live forever, to defeat aging, to defeat everything. The War against Aging, as one magazine which I was asked to subscribe to \u201cjoin us in the war against aging.\u201d ","Questioner: Sounds like we might lose. ","Larry: What? ","Questioner: Sounds like we might lose. ","Larry: Yes. It's like, \u201cwe declare war on the Atlantic Ocean.\u201d The battle is already\u2026 You can raise your handkerchief as the white flag. It's over. So, it's that view of things. But the possibilities of vanity and getting attached to the nature of the body and attractiveness and health and youthfulness of the body has always been there. The Buddhists specifically talked to it. And a reflection that you get in many Buddhist monasteries no matter what age you are it's given to young people, really young. \u201cI'm of the nature to age. I'm not exempt from that. Everyone ages.\u201d You reflect on it, not to be a downer. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you to let the kid enjoy his youth?\u201d It's not that. It's that often there's tremendous vanity attached with youth and with health because it's if we have it forever and we don't. Ok, so there are many safeguards. Some of you have been around the block a while with Buddhist meditations, you know about them. They're reflections and contemplations to balance it.

And in this lineage, in this approach, what's emphasized is seeing the three poisons of the mind, the three toxins of poisons. You've heard it, if you've been around here. They\u2019re sometimes called greed or grasping or the wanting mind, that mind that's always wanting something. It can be very subtle. It can be enormous. And it can want anything, from sex to food to power to money to fame to a whole country to anything. It's constantly wanting to become something better than what it thinks it is, to get more than what it thinks it doesn't have. That mind is considered a toxin. ","Break_line: Of course, you need desires. It's not saying desire is bad. When that mind is there, the practice is to be mindful of it, to come to know it. It's in its form as an obsession, fixation that it produces suffering. Obviously, the desire to eat and to take care of yourself is a natural part of survival. What I'm talking about is what produces suffering when it's out of control and distorts everything else. ","Break_line: So, self-knowledge would of course begin to, in those mind moments, it's not in the abstract, it can come up anywhere. It's coming to see in those mind moments, is there craving and wanting in that moment? Want want want. And if there is, what's that like? See that's where the learning how to live comes in. It's not saying, don't crave and don't want because it's bad. You're a bad person. What it's saying is, it's an unskillful mental state. It doesn't work. It doesn't bring happiness. It brings suffering to you and to others. ","Break_line: And so, when the mind is in that state of neediness, of wanting, don't be in a hurry to rid yourself of it. Slip in under and see what that's like. Is it a nice feeling? If so, carry on. Make it even stronger. Accumulate even more. More fame, more money, more sex, more power, more whatever it is you want. More shoes, more cars, more\u2026 I don't know. It can be anything. More meditation accolades. The mind is free to latch onto anything and turn it into a torture chamber or heaven. Okay, so what's the mind like when it's that way? What's the mind like when it isn't that way? When the mind is at peace with the way things are? Again, learning happens. ","Break_line: In some ways, it's not so different from old Pavlov and Skinner because a lot of learning goes on that way. We begin to see this learning is painful. It doesn't produce happiness. That's wisdom. All these religious paths exist because suffering exists. If there was no human suffering, would we need religions in churches and synagogues and mosques? I don't think so. We need them because we're suffering a lot. And to some degree, they may help. I want to get into, that's a big one, right? ","Break_line: And so how do you learn? It's not to just follow it blindly. It's not a new belief. Buddhists don't believe to not grasp on to things that everything is empty and arises and passes away. Fine. I'm a Buddhist now. I believe it. And however many Buddhists are on the world, I feel a sense of belonging. We Buddhists feel that there's no self and we don't believe in grasping. I think at a certain point, it won't be very fulfilling. It's just another belief. It's dead. It doesn't have much liberating power, if any. In fact, it may just do the reverse. ","Break_line: And as you begin to see when the mind is content, as one of my teachers called it \u201cjust enough mind\u201d rather than \u201cnot enough mind,\u201d to see that. So that's a valuable piece of self-knowledge. It enables you to learn your way out of certain emotional states that are not working for you. If they are, full speed ahead, of course.

Or when you feel just generous and the joy of giving but genuine giving? And so, you begin to feel your way or learn your way into ways of reeducating your own mind. And only you can do it. It doesn't come from a book. It comes from reading your own nature. ","Break_line: Now the meditation practice, which in Buddhism is central, is designed to equip the mind so that it's strong, stable, and clear enough to be able to do this work. Because if the mind has no steadiness, my words may sound reasonable to you, but you won't be able to do it because as soon as fear comes or something else comes, blown away. Well, that's true for all of us at the beginning. But it's like any other art. It can be learned. If you want to learn this art, do you want to learn how to live? Maybe you're happy the way you're living already. Good. Maybe you just came here out of curiosity or your boyfriend comes here, your girlfriend comes here. You're welcome. But that doesn't have much energy.

That is, when the mind is confused, dark, ambivalent, ignorant, hesitant, befuddled, bewildered. Because the root problem in the Buddhist teaching is ignorance in the mind. That is, the mind is deluded. And that's why it thinks that the more it grasps and accumulates, the happier it will be. It really believes that. When the mind gets clear and looks at it, it sees that that's not so, not as a new ideology. You can have lots of stuff and be happy or you can have very little stuff and be happy. That's not the point. The point is what is that quality of mind and what does it produce and what are the consequences, whether you call it karma or cause and effect. If you're willing to see how you actually live, you can begin to see those actions, verbal and otherwise, that are beneficial for you and for others. You can see the ones that aren't. ","Break_line: But are you willing to learn? Are you willing to actually learn? Sometimes what that means is seeing mistakes and apologizing. Sometimes it means being very discouraged and seeing, \u201cmy God, I thought I was through that one but I guess I'm not.\u201d But it's not to give you a final report card. What we're learning is how to live a real life. The only way that I know that life can be real is if we are, if we're real. And so, how do you do that? So, the seeing has to become more and more accurate and clear. ","Break_line: To begin with, our minds are not clear because we're invested. We have strong likes and dislikes. When the mind is not clear, it's not enjoyable. I think we all know that. And so, see what that's like when the mind is so confused and makes decisions that it doesn't even have confidence in. And see what it's like when the mind feels clear. Sometimes that mind comes upon you, in meditation certainly, but it's not limited to meditation. Suddenly life is so much simpler. You see, someone's hungry, you see somebody's sad, someone's happy. And it's obvious what to do. Life is not any easier in one sense, but the simplicity of it, which comes from the clear seeing, enables the behavior to be appropriate, accurate, wise, kinder. You can see that that's a big piece of the practice.

What I'm about to say is not new because the problem that we have has existed since the time of the Buddha. It exists now and it existed\u2026 who knows? In the Buddhist scheme of things, it's a beginningless beginning. There isn't some origin of the universe. It's sort of like on and on and on. ","Break_line: When you have something as striking as that unexpected event that occurred where thousands of people who are just helplessly killed. And I don't have to repeat that, you all know what it is. It is quite, can be, for most human beings, it is quite a shock, just as an individual shock. Someone who's in good health suddenly dies, and everyone's surprised, or some disappointment or just the opposite, just something totally unexpected happens. ","Break_line: Every moment is a moment to learn about yourself. But this one has tremendous potential. That is because there's so much energy that's trapped in the reactions that come about when something as dramatic as this happens. The tremendous amount of fear, the anger, the apprehension about the future, seeing perhaps how uncomfortable you are with not knowing the future. ","Break_line: See, again, it\u2019s self-knowledge, it never takes a holiday. So that whatever happens, in addition to it being a social event which the whole planet shares, it's an individual event. How are you taking what has happened? Forget about how anyone else has. I've been speaking to really a lot of people for months now, not only here but elsewhere. Some people will say, \u201cI don't feel all the horror and the terror that so many other people do. And I feel bad about that.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, that's what you practice with. How do you feel?\u201d \u201cWell, I just feel a little bit neutral.\u201d \u201cOkay, start there. Don't feel you're supposed to feel like someone else.\u201d ","Break_line: Self-knowledge is really training in honesty. But it's not that you ever have to tell anyone else. It's you being honest with you, which is most important. Even if you lie and do something awful and never get caught, no one ever finds out, you found out, and it forms a residue in the consciousness, perhaps sinks down in the subconscious. But it's there, and it has a debilitating effect. It's a psychic toxin just like food that's inappropriate, it can be a toxin for the body. ","Break_line: Okay, so what is happening elicits very strong reactions. And, if you're a person of practice, if you are a yogi, you're practicing Vipassana or some other meditation. This is a hard time for everyone. There is no one who is exempt from it. But it can be also a very rich time for you because it can unearth fears and problems that have nothing to do with 911. Many people have seen that: fears that they thought they were done with or that they had basically had buried since childhood, old wounds. If you're willing to practice with it and begin to take a look at what this brings up, a lot can be learned. In order to do that, of course, the clearer you're seeing is, the better. ","Break_line: I'm going to go a little bit over if you don't mind, but I don't think it will be more than 5 minutes over. I know some of you have a tight schedule.

Some of you are relatively new. Maybe you just walked in and this sounds interesting. You can start practicing right now. It's not to wait until the mind is perfect. Whereas if you have an interest in understanding your life as you live it out - understanding here is not just thinking understanding. It's not chronic introspection; we already know how to do that. Many of us do. It's not that. It's much fresher and more alive and actually finally enjoyable because it brings energy. You don't get headaches from this one even though sometimes what you see is painful. So, we start with a mind that is ill-equipped perhaps to do this, and we have to do the best we can. I don't know.

And, I was watching an interview with an Afghani woman who obviously had suffered a great deal from the Taliban, and she was trying to describe the condition situation for women in Afghanistan for the past five years. The interview is, there's a question and answer going, but do you know what crawl is? Those of you don't know it crawl is that incessant nonstop ticker tape that keeps going. \u201c\u2026Osama bin Laden has been founder\u2026 A president\u2026 A president just receives an award\u2026\u201d It keeps going I guess 24 hours a day.

I mean, someone is asleep here. You know, get rid of that.\u201d In the meantime, I've missed 30 seconds of what this poor woman is saying. On top of that, on the upper right hand where, they start showing what's going on in Kandahar: bombing and you know. And, so there I am, and there's an announcer and music and I'm trying to watch. This woman is trying to tell her story. And I'm really interested. And, in the meantime, the crawl is getting me, sort of like, I'm looking up there, and then Kandahar\u2019s over here with planes. And, finally, it just occurred to me, who designed this? This is insane. I said, somebody must think that this is a good way to do things. And I realized, of course they do, because that's how their normal mind is. I realized this is how our mind is. ","Break_line: Let's say, right now, maybe this, you\u2019re more focused here hopefully. There's something happening and you're aware of it. In the meantime, the crawl is always going on. The mind is starting to say blah blah blah blah\u2026used to be\u2026I will be\u2026 That's a lot of baloney, but smile anyway. And then you think that Kandahar is just happening in the upper right. Then there are images floating through your mind at the same time that you're looking and the crawl and the images, and that's the mind we're going through life with. ","Break_line: Meditation exists because that mind exists. And it's sort of like, how can at least sometimes turn crawl off? Let Kandahar take a rest and just listen to the woman tell her story without music and America fights\u2013all of this hoopla. Just a simple story of one person asking a question, seemed to me that was much more powerful than whoever drummed up that. That's what we're up against. ","Break_line: By the way, sometimes people who are new get the idea that, \u201cOh, what he's saying is that thinking is no good.\u201d I'm not saying that. Thinking is magnificent and necessary and beautiful. It's created so much. It's just that we don't know how to use thinking. Thinking is using us. It would be as if you have a beautiful car, whatever car you like, Mercedes. I don't know, whatever car you like. And, it's great and you drive it around, but then you have to get over a lake. You don't drive the car into the lake to get to the other side. The car can do certain things and it can't do certain other things. So you get out of the car and you get on a boat. Do you see where you get it? We're using thinking in areas where it's counterproductive. For example, we're trying to measure what's immeasurable.

As you get to know your own mind, you're getting to know everyone else's mind too. No matter where you go. If you prick us, we bleed. We don't like it when our children are hurt or die. We're afraid to get all\u2026we're all humans in back of all the different outfits and cultures and foods and ideologies and all the rest of it. And as you get to know yourself, I have found it to be so, without any special effort, you do start understanding other people better because we're the same. ","Break_line: To jump a lot of steps. To whatever degree my mind became clearer because I've been looking at what this has evoked in me. It has evoked things in me. And without going into my particular biography because it's not important. Because what's important is what this event has and may in the future bring up for you. In those moments when the mind is clear, what I have seen and I'm not telling you to see this, and this didn't come from books that I read, although I'm sure there's nothing novel or particularly interesting or creative about it, but I saw it myself, a lot of it from watching news and listening to people. ","Break_line: First of all, what becomes really apparent is that there's an enormous gap between technology and wisdom. It's like Grand Canyon. Wisdom is feeble. I mean planet, the level of understanding on the planet, the level of maturity of us human beings. We haven't learned how to live together. And it seems as if we don't want to spend energy doing that. Our energy has gone in the direction of magnificent technological accomplishments. I'm not saying to stop that, but if all the best energy of every generation goes in that direction, don't be surprised if we don't understand ourselves because it's not held up as an important value. It just isn't. So, children are brought up to become great scientists or technicians or whatever it is. ","Break_line: We're not brought up that the quality of your life is supreme, really important. You're here to live your life. What is the quality of that life? Not the gross national product. Now that's okay. So education isn't just to get a job. Education should be to understand yourself. It's part of education. So, I think that part of the problem is an immense, the wisdom is overwhelmed by technology. We can't handle it. We've created energies that are so far beyond our grasp that we're all in danger. This is not about the Al Qaeda or Taliban, that's topical. We're all in this together. It's a planetary problem. And the sooner we see it, the better. And our contribution to it is there. ","Break_line: And I'm not saying I'm a fanatical 60\u2019s peacenik who we just never recovered from the 60\u2019s. I'm not saying that. It just seems obvious that it isn't as simple as good guys and bad guys. That to some degree, each one of us has contributed to what's going on. If we still have lots of greed and craving, we want lots of things. And if we want lots of things, they have to come from somewhere, and we need the energy and we want it. And then parts of the world, the energy comes from there. And in the process, all kinds of imbalances are developed. Like we have to have oil from the Middle East in order to do what we like to do. And we don't want to be deprived of that. That's an individual thing. And someone would say, \u201cWell, we should get out of Saudi Arabia, but you'll have to turn your thermostats down to 60.\u201d \u201cWell, I don't know. I mean Saudi Arabia looks pretty good to me. They like us. You know, they just can't say it publicly. So I hear.\u201d ","Break_line: Anyway, the gap between the massive power of technology and the lack of development in us as individuals, self-knowledge, and extend that to the race, the human race, that is. I feel it comes down to something like this. It's not that I want you to believe this. It's that, find out what you see. This came out of some seeing. What I see is that the power of the media has created, helped create in a dramatic way, a global economy. And everyone's talking about that, how wonderful it is. But, when you look at the media, it's very clear what's going on. It's not to me\u2026 it's that we have a global economy, but we don't have a global consciousness. ","Break_line: Consciousness is tribal still, and that includes us\u2013if you have a better word, sectarian, nationalistic\u2013so that you have people, we're all in each other's faces through the media and through the global economy. But consciousness is not the kind of consciousness that can live in a global economy because we're still mired in tribal mentality where it's all about me and everyone's doing it. I'm not singling out America. ","Break_line: The United Nations is a bunch of self-interested individual countries jockeying for power and influence, and veto this and that. So certain people are rubbing up, cultures are rubbing up against each other. They're not ready for it. They don't understand them. We don't understand. And yet we keep coming together and coming together. There has to be a commensurate development of consciousness. ","Break_line: And so when you work on yourself as an individual this may sound really utopian, and maybe it is, but personally I'm going to do it anyway even if it doesn't help the world. I am doing it, I hope. As you work on, because greed, hatred, and delusion, we can see it in our own individual life. But the world is an extension of that. Countries get greedy and countries get angry and countries solidify and countries simplify reality. I just want to leave it at that. So in working on yourself you are in some, even if it's tiny way, contributing, planting a seed, if you will, for a world where we go deeper. ","Break_line: Because right now we're living in such superficialities. We are willing to do business with each other but we take the most superficial aspect of the person to be what's real. It isn't what's really real. Anyone who's meditated knows that. When you go deep, you're not a Jew or an Arab or even a Buddhist, for goodness sakes. When the mind is clear there's no name tag for it, there's no brand name, there's no label or slogan that applies. It's just your being, there's being is there. And it's wonderful. ","Break_line: And it's not that we have to abandon our particular country and ethnic group and that adds the color to the life. But it doesn't have to be held with such ferocity and such making. We're so identified with the surface of what's going on because we haven't gone deep enough into ourselves. That if everyone's doing that and it's so great that we have a global economy, but we have a provincial mind, how can that work? And so, I would say maybe it's self-serving because I'm in the business, but self-understanding is what's really called for now. ","Break_line: There's a shortage not of energy but of understanding and that's for all of us. We don't understand ourselves as a planet. And all the conferences and legislation and peace treaties, they're helpful. I'm not against doing sensible things. They just are so weak and feeble because the mind states haven't changed. Just look at what happened to the Communists even if you like it. A good ideology, but people were just the same people, and it didn't work. The inner is much more powerful than the outer, finally. ","Break_line: Okay, I'll get down from my soapbox. But it's not\u2026Please, I really, sincerely beg of you. I am not trying to convince you of any political ideology or whether you should be for the war against the war, protests. Let the clarity of your own mind help you know how to behave from here on in because if what's been said is so, it's not over. It's going to unfold and there are going to be more challenges. The practice should help you live in the midst of those challenges by developing some more wisdom, so that even though we're all challenged you're not overwhelmed by what happens. ","Break_line: Okay. If anyone has to leave, please, and let's start the questioning in. Let's give it a minute or two.

It's a Winter Wonderland. \u201cHey, that was terrific.\u201d \u201cWhoa, that's a good shot.\u201d ","Break_line: But I'm not offering that as a formula, as a recipe, like next time, do that. I'm saying out of clear mind can come surprising responses not reactions. Reactions are mechanical and typically don't help because the energy is very different. When the mind is clear there's a much better chance the response of being adequate, appropriate, and actually helpful. Do you see what I mean? Again, no guarantees. Yeah. ","Break_line: Is everyone clear on that? And that's why self-knowledge, it\u2019s so\u2026 it helps you live. It really helps because you can save yourself a lot of wear and tear not getting angry at everything that happens to you. After all who got angry? Your sense of being separate and having a right to your space and walking and going home and not being, whatever, blah blah. As you see that, that starts to fall away. In practice, it gets lighter, thinner, more transparent, and the snowball hits emptiness. It isn't experience, it's that big a deal. Or the reaction becomes much weaker. ","Questioner: Yeah. I think years ago before I started to meditate, I would have had a bigger reaction\u2013bigger might have even gotten into some real problem with these kids. ","Larry: Right. It sounds like you almost did. ","Questioner: Yeah. But a little less than maybe a few years ago. ","Larry: Right. The Taoists have a very nice way of putting it, that is: if you're in a boat going down the river and another boat crashes into you, but there's no one in it, you don't get angry. But if there's someone in it, you get furious.

","Larry: You're not sure. Doubt. You have to see the mind, self-knowing would be like, \u201cI'm not sure. He keeps saying that as if it's automatic. It just grows, comes with the territory. Just show up, come on Wednesday nights, do a retreat now and then, maybe go to IMS, and then one day I'll just be just like him seeing everything ready. So, you see doubt there. Sounds like you have some doubts. Do you? ","Questioner: Sure. ","Larry: Okay. That's normal. It's not unique to you. ","Questioner: I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m sinning my doubting or anything. What's your advice about working\u2026since thought seems to be the only tool I have right now for self-awareness. Not the only tool because occasionally I think I'm mindful for a millisecond or something. What's your advice about using thoughts? So, if I'm meditating and thinking about myself, do I stay with that thought and be thoughtful about myself? Should it be, \u201cOh, back to the breath. Like, that's a thought and so let it go.\u201d I'm sure there's a transition over time to something else. ","Larry: Okay, if you're sure, then I don't have to answer. First of all, let's be clear what mindfulness is. There's no thinking in mindfulness. Otherwise, it's not what we're talking about. Now, you can be mindful of something, and thoughts are going on but they're not in any way hampering the clear seeing. So, it's not like you have to stamp out thought, but the thoughts don't have that compelling quality. Now with practice, especially as you start knowing the difference between thinking and everything else. ","Break_line: See, right now, the mind to begin with is quite confused because\u2026 one very important chapter of self-knowledge has to do with understanding the role of thought in life, and to see how limited it is. That in its proper place, it's magnificent. But we have equated it with living itself. We have given a tremendous authority, probably many if not most of us\u2013for all I know, everyone in this room\u2013makes a living from thought. You're probably good at it in some realm. ","Break_line: Okay, it's not to stop that but all spiritual life, the real religious mind\u2013this is not particularly Buddhist, but the Buddha is very perhaps unique\u2013I don't know enough about all the religions\u2013to leave a clear roadmap and clear methods to do it. The religious mind is to go beyond all this. In other words, that's the immeasurable that I mentioned earlier on. Now, all you can do is if I tell you something I don't think it's very helpful. All you can do is begin to pay attention to how you live. ","Break_line: Now, there is a form of insight that's kind of still helpful and it's not just for beginners. It's called reflective insight. And that's where seeing and reason and logic and intelligence, putting two and two together, is useful. And then there's direct insight. The direct insight is uncommon. Probably you don't have that unless you learn how to do it. And that's why we're here. ","Break_line: The reflective insight, probably everyone in this room already knows how to use it, and it can be refined where you get a sense of things. Let's say you see the World Trade Center, the towers go down. From that point on many people have a deeper understanding of the impermanent nature of life. And it's mixed with thought. Some people, let's say if you see it and it goes so deeply into the heart that it goes well beyond the World Trade Center, when you start to realize even without the World Trade Center, it's always been like that. Everything is impermanent and doesn't have an enduring core. It's empty of an autonomous self. So there are different levels of depth of insight. The deepest comes from a seeing that has nothing to do with previous accumulations, meaning thinking, knowledge, and so forth. That doesn't mean it's worthless. And on the way what you're saying is useful too. Sure. ","Break_line: But practice mindfulness as best you can. Use it in simple ways. It's not finally about the breath. The breath is there to help you be mindful. It's about being mindful about what's going on. Take simple activities like the dishes, and make it a meditation. You're washing the dishes and notice the mind. And then you just gently come back. Just gently come back, and just do the dishes. And let that extend out to more complicated matters which are, of course, more difficult. And the snowball thing is more complicated because there's a threat involved. And we know what teenagers are capable of now and who knows what it could lead to. But you have to start where you are. Otherwise, it would be an impersonation. But what you're doing is not a waste of time. Not at all. Yeah, please.

It's that we're here to help you understand how you do it. ","Questioner: If you could give us an example of. ","Larry: Well, I gave you one. I told you that by following my own reactions the mind became quiet. And I saw that this is a world problem. It's a planetary problem and that all of us are contributing to it by having minds that are not contemporary with the way the world is now. The mind is still tribal. That's the best term I can come up with. And the world is changing so fast that boundaries, we\u2019re are all intermingling, and we don't know what to do with it. The Soviet Union falls apart and suddenly you have everything, endless ethnic groups emerging with pride and flags and foods and fighting and all. Whereas what the world needs is not that. And begin to understand, like let's say if you get critical of what the president's doing or what's going on, take a look and look into yourself. ","Break_line: For example, if your kind of patriotism, let's say, personally I'll go this far: I love the United States. I come from an immigrant background. I know what my parents have been through. I inherited their suffering in other countries. And America has been incredibly good to me. I have no words for it. I did serve in the military blah blah blah. But all I'm trying to say is that it doesn't. And I'm Jewish. It doesn't stop me. But it's taken work over the years. I have a deep love of Israel. I can't help it. It's conditioned. But, for a while now, I honestly feel tremendous sympathy for the Palestinians. And I hear the Israelis argument is so one-sided. It's like they produce something and then they complain as to why they get hit back. But then the Palestinians are doing it as well. It's like neither of them can be happy unless the other one is. And all they do is so that I'm able to let's say love this country but not set it up in such an exclusive way that I can't hear what certain Arab thoughts are, certain criticism of what's going on and try to weigh it. Even the bad guy, Osama bin Laden, I've tried to listen to what he's saying. Some of his critique is not insane. The solution is not as it may be. And him as a person is not that interesting to me. ","Break_line: So, if you're willing to, everything that's going on reveals something about yourself. So, in some ways I'm contributing to it by\u2026 let's say if I'm marching around with the flag\u2013and I've seen it in Harvard Square where someone was doing a political thing, and this was within the first two weeks. They didn't have an American flag, and someone came over. It wasn't even about pacifism. It was about a different political candidate in the next election. And I said, \u201cWell, where's your American flag? You never served in the military.\u201d I saw the beginnings of a fight. And I looked at this person and said, \u201cI'm a vet. And how come you\u2026\u201d and so that kind of American stuff is not helping anyone and that's part of what has contributed to it. And then we're all doing it to each other. ","Break_line: So, if you can liberate yourself \u2013 and, of course, the Buddhist teaching is no matter what you say, it's always, like, start with you. I will say something. This may sound, I hope it doesn't sound conceited. To me, it's something that grows out of practice. There is hope. The period prior to this happening and for a while prior has been an extremely happy one for me, and it has not been interfered with by this. There's just a tremendous ongoing joy. It comes from meditation, quite honestly. And I also like my life, but I also have experienced sorrow. They both can coexist. The sorrow has been sometimes about the low level at which the human race is steeped. It's not abstract to me. It's sort of like how can we do this to each other? Okay so there's a certain depth of something that doesn't get pushed around by the event and all of us have it. That's the point of what the Buddha is saying. There's something in us that's stronger than anything that happens to us. Whatever name\u2013I won't name it for right now\u2013whether you call it Buddha nature, original nature, and it's accessible to begin to taste it. Okay. That doesn't mean you become like a stone. If anything, it's more poignant. You become more sensitive to cruelty and so forth. And both are coexisting inside of me. But there's a foundation that doesn't seem to budge. If you think that's egocentric, I'm not saying I'm a big enlightened guy, I'm just trying to describe something.

And kind of, it sounds a little bit dramatic and silly to put in the language, but I've had this for the last several years. And it's definitely increased over the last year, and it's accelerated even more this past fall. And, on the one level I know it's an opportunity. ","Larry: For what? I just want to make sure what I hear you saying is more and more you're starting to recognize, deeply, the obvious truth that you're going to die. Yeah. Now what? ","Questioner: And yet I find that I get very scared in that moment and not really able to go too much farther with that. ","Larry: There's nothing next. Because you want to solve the problem by going farther, you're not facing the fear. Do you see what I'm getting at? The practice is so exquisitely simple minded. If you remember this, it applies to almost anything you can tell me. It doesn't mean you don't act, because you have to often act, and you do the best you can, like with the snowball or whatever it is. But if death has brought up fear, that means you're alive. And the Buddha has intentional contemplations to accomplish that. We don't need that right now because this event has made it more authentic in a way than any in a sense artificial reflection which then brings up fear. ","Break_line: But do you have a practice? Do you do this practice or something like it? Yeah. So then, the fact that fear comes up is fine. Then practice with it and don't get invested. \u201cWell, I still have a little bit of fear left. I have a little bit less.\u201d Take it from moment to moment. Life keeps\u2026 liberate yourself from this moment. Because, in the moment when you're afraid but you're not awake, you're enslaved. In the Buddhist sense, you're attached, you're enslaved. But in a breath, if you wake up and meet the fear with openness and receptivity, that doesn't mean it's not going to still be fearful. It will, but it's a very different experience when the fear is experienced consciously. You do that a few more times and fear becomes workable. You begin to see, \u201coh, fear is just fear. It's no more than that.\u201d Then you start to begin to see, \u201cwell how come I'm so afraid?\u201d You'll see that it grows out of thinking. Right now, you're not dying. I mean except in a profound way we all are. And so, that you've had thoughts about your impending death at some time in the future. ","Break_line: Now the reason I said now what? Because if you just bring up the fear of death and you don't do anything creative or useful with it, then what's the point? You've just made your life more frightening, and it's not wisdom or liberation. Do you see what I'm getting at? Don't think of liberation as some Stephen Spielberg special effect. Sometimes there are breakthroughs that happen in meditation that are quite dramatic. But most of it is blue collar labor. And there's a moment of freedom, a moment of slavery, and just take it one moment at a time. In the moment, insight meditation is the practice of liberation. In a moment of either grasping or pushing away, you're not free. If you pay attention, you'll see what it feels like. But again, if you suddenly see how you're holding on or what that feels like, it tends to loosen. And you're still afraid, but it has a different energy altogether.

Let's say fear comes. Okay. Throw the word fear out. There's an energy that's there. And you could feel it coursing through the body, right? There's very strong bodily sensations if you're afraid; it's not vague. The heart, the posture changes, well, you know. That's available. Go right to that with mindfulness. And then the mind will start churning out thoughts that are all disabling. \u201cYou're going to die. You'll be crippled. It\u2019s doom. It's hopeless.\u201d They're ideas. They're just thoughts. ","Break_line: Now with practice you can begin to see that they're just thoughts. And if you can attend to the energy of the fear with mindfulness, that means sustained seeing. And, at first, that's hard to do because we're afraid to look at fear. Most people never begin. They're lowered into the grave with fear, I'm afraid. Whoop. I didn't mean to be clever, but it's true. I'm not really afraid of that. ","Break_line: But what I've seen in the people that I've worked with and myself, unless you get fed up with fear\u2013and that is a piece of self-knowledge\u2013you begin to see the price you're paying for fear: how it cripples you, cuts off all kinds of creativity, prevents you from taking certain risks that could be creative and useful. And you begin to see that it's quite a steep price that we pay for allowing fear to control us. But then there's an incentive to gently, softly start inching towards it. ","Break_line: And it's the same practices with the breathing: it's to receive it as it is. It's just energy. See what I'm getting at? Okay. That's the purest and the most direct way. And at first it'll be hard because there'll be resistance. You'll be afraid to look at fear or you hate it. And then, so you look at that. You look at how much energy there is in not wanting to look at fear. You heard what I said. Did you understand my words just now? Seriously, it's a question. Okay. ","Break_line: And let's say fear comes up and you say, \u201cGreat, it sounded good up in that hall. But now the last thing I want to do is take a look at my fear.\u201d Then take a look at that. Take a look at how much you don't want to look at fear, at resistance. You'll feel the body. It's not about fear now. It's contraction in the face of fear. And then little by little you learn your way into how to\u2026 you see fear is workable because it's observable. If it weren't observable, it would be hopeless. It isn't hopeless. ","Break_line: But it's just like any other art: the art of cooking, the art of painting. It's putting things in their right place. Fear has a proper place in life. Sometimes it's quite intelligent and saves us. But a lot of it\u2013the fear we're talking about now\u2013is neurotic fear. There isn't a real threat in this moment. It's not doing you any good.

You can be gentle, but it does take a certain courage at the beginning and an incentive, an interest in wanting to really understand this so you can be free of fear or at least weaken it. I've seen people with horrible panic attacks, horrible, learn how to disarm them. And they're not doing it\u2026It's the same old, boring Vipassana technique. Nothing new. It's just that what you're being asked to be mindful of is not something you want to be mindful of. And it's a rough one, but it too can be learned. ","Break_line: So let's reenact it. \u201cOh my God, this is overwhelming.\u201d Start right there. Forget about fear. Just realize that you've already concluded that this is hopeless. And, it may be so big that right now your awareness isn't ready for it. There may be an element of truth in what you're saying.

That concentrates the mind and that makes the mind more fit, strong, steady. It needn\u2019t be the breath. It can be mantra. There are many, many ways. But you take one thing and you come back to it again and again and again. Okay. Out of that, the mind starts becoming more steady. And so then, you won't be as likely to feel overwhelmed because probably it's true. ","Break_line: Your mindfulness is a baby mindfulness. You haven't done so much of it and certainly not with fear. And so it is easily overwhelmed. So, it's both in a way. That is, you start little by little approaching it and seeing that maybe it's workable. But also, see, every time you're mindful, that's what gets stronger not just on the cushion. You mindfully do the dishes. You're taking a walk into the square and you're aware of the experience of moving. Every time you mindfully hear a bird chirp, the car stops because it's a red light, and you're with three or four breaths until the light becomes green and you drive. All of that contributes to refashioning and reshaping the mind so that it is able to do the things that I'm talking about. ","Break_line: It's not like you walk in here, you hear this rap, and then like, far out man and you just do it. This is not a quick fix. This practice is for adults. What the Buddha is saying is you're responsible for your own happiness. And we are being given the tools both in terms of teachings and also techniques to enable the mind to be up to the task of looking at itself. Because to begin with it probably isn't.

It's like a department store after some of the piles of, you name it, and you go into his \u201ckuti\u201d or his little house and all I saw was a jar of medicine and a map and a cot and mosquito netting.

Just a final few words about this center and dana. This center totally exists because of dana. This, by the way, is not a pitch for collection or anything. As I was talking, it reminded me of the synagogue days where at the end suddenly it would get quiet and then the Rabbi would talk about what was needed, all the donations and so forth. I don't think that's what I'm doing. Maybe unconsciously I am. I hope not. ","Break_line: We've wrestled with this. The center itself is supported by donations, some large, some very small, membership, et cetera. Most of us who are involved with the Center, let's say on the board and people who are teaching here, we would love to be able to just give the teachings away free, just for you all to just come here whenever you'd like and to leave whenever you'd like. And to be no charge for any classes, talks, retreats, what have you, and just leave it up to you. ","Break_line: But the problem is\u2013it's a very practical one\u2013is that we have to pay our bills on a monthly basis. And in the West, you don't have that notion. In fact, why should you? The practice is too new here. It hasn't been here long enough for you have to derive the fruit with such depth that you, out of your own spontaneity, want to support the place. I mean we don't want to have to be saying, \u201cWell you know, if you don't give us money, we can't pay the rent or whatever it is. Or we can't pay our electric bill,\u201d which would be more like it.

And that's IMS, those of you know IMS is a mixture. That is, you pay a certain fee which covers the running of IMS. But then, whatever you give to teachers is up to you. Here we try to keep the prices as low as we can within the limits of us surviving as an organization, with costs. And I hope you see it that way. Also, no one to my knowledge has ever been turned away because of money, either to be a member or to do a retreat. So we tried to, in our own way, balance that by we need a certain standard amount of money on a monthly basis so that the center can operate smoothly.

That's what I meant: the deeper the threat, the greater the possibility for growth. Okay, but you have to recognize it and do something with it. So our culture, the planet. For example\u2013 this is just my big fat opinion, everything I said tonight. ","Break_line: But anyway, we keep talking about the global economy, and that's a good thing. Not everyone thinks that, but most global economy, free trade, and all that. But we don't have a global consciousness to match the global economy. So we think happiness is in more trade. And then we'll all have what? Better, more objects? Better cars? We already have that. We know it's not enough. That's why America is the spiritual capital of the planet because we've already gone there. We've seen, like, it's great to have a lot of stuff, but it ain't enough. What needs to happen, if it can, something like this, perhaps\u2013this is an optimistic twist on it\u2013is that out of the desperation of seeing what we've created\u2026 but we have to start seeing it that we're all in this together.

So, this could be something where we start to recognize that we've all helped create each other, and we all need each other\u2026and the global consciousness and global economy. You see, because otherwise what you have is we're in each other's face, but we don't have a global consciousness. Tv and travel\u2026 everyone's\u2026 and goods, now. Everything, that's circulating. ","Break_line: But it's still the same tribal mind. We all have the same tribal mind. Me, you. Every day there's like a new ethnic group. Now I got to know the Pashtuns but before that it was the Uzbeckis. I don't care about California, but I got to know about how the Kazakhstans are doing now. And each one has its own pride in our culture and our dishes and our dances and our outfits and our dignity. I'm sort of like holy mackerel. Everything's becoming one. Just endless proliferation of ethnic groups. That doesn't have to disappear. But the ferocity with which it's held. How can you have a global consciousness when everyone is so provincial, so tribal? And yet the goods are going around, but we don't have a mind\u2013it's an invitation for trouble. Do you see what I'm getting at? ","Break_line: So, when you work on yourself\u2013that it sounds utopian, and no doubt it is\u2013you're doing peace work. Anytime you can become less violent, less judgmental, et cetera, have a bigger consciousness so that you understand that this is all superficial: Arabs and Jews. That's just like outer garments. We're all human. If we can only connect with that. You can still be a Jew and an Arab; you can still be Buddhist and Christian. That's not necessarily suffering, unless you grasp onto it. ","Break_line: You see, and that's one of the most dangerous, perhaps the most dangerous attachment. In the Buddhist terms, it's one of the hardest things to get free of: attachment to views and opinions. The terrorists had it. They really felt they had a monopoly on the truth. No doubt they were happy believing they're going to heaven with virgins dancing around. And, for them, it's true. And they're willing to keep you know. So the most dangerous thing if you read history have been religious ideologies. When you get fanaticism under the flag of religion, get out of the way. It's impossible because people feel they have God on their side. ","Break_line: Okay, now, so it's not the ethnic groups or the religions per se that's the problem. But this provincial\u2013 and bring it down to our level. We're doing it with each other, in our families. Why can't we live together? Why can't we be at peace with each other?

Supposing this person is doing their thing, but you've examined the part you're doing. But not just thinking; you actually see it, and it gets weaker and falls away.

And you penetrate to a deeper level of understanding of the law of impermanence at work in your own mind, body. And that has transformative power. You're already on your way. You\u2019re launched.

Some are so attached to their minds that they're going to suffer tremendously. Whatever the mind churns up, it's true. They grab, and it's just immense torment. But as you start to see what, the mind is impermanent. It's not just that the people were. One minute you were this, the next minute you were that. And you see what the nature of the mind, it's not a thing. It's a process: full of contradictions and randomness and unpredictability and it's out of your control. Then it loses its power. And that takes you to a much deeper place that we were talking about, which is here right now. Okay. Emptiness.

And let's say, which I think there's some truth to, I was attached to a form. It was a good place. It protected me. Just anyone knows even if it's a humble little place, it's your own. And you can do what you want in there and be quiet. Now if I'm really holding on to that, and then it's taken away from me, then I suffer a lot. And then someone comes along and said, \u201cHey, you're attached to it. That's why you're suffering. Look what they're doing. They're tearing it down, and they're making it into a meditation hall.\u201d And you come back and you look at it and then, you're right. It was nothing. The attachment to emptiness then is like a kind of disrespect for the form. The apartment had its value. If you attach to the emptiness you're getting attached to the\u2026 ","Break_line: Let me use an example that's more within all of our range. Flowers. Anyone who loves flowers, probably everyone here or most of us, we love flowers. And you put them in water, and then they're beautiful, and we love to look at them, and their scent and so forth. And then they start to wither and wilt, and then they die, right. Maybe the first few times you start sobbing. But typically, now as adults, we see it in some Buddhist monasteries, it's a practice to let it go to the point of withering. They don't immediately take it out and put another fresh batch in because they want you to see it as a teaching. Not overdo it when it starts to be like that. So, you watch the flowers and you enjoyed them while they were there. ","Break_line: Now, here are other ways of doing it. If you got totally attached to flowers, then you would suffer immensely every time they withered. That part is clear to you, right? Okay. But supposing you say, \u201cThey're worthless. I'm never going to have a flower again. They just go and die on you because what do they do? They just come up and then they go blah blah and then they're gone.\u201d Okay. That would be in the direction of attachment to emptiness. ","Break_line: It's fine to love the flower as you understand its nature. If you understand its nature, you don't have expectations that have nothing to do with its nature. You want it to last forever. It can't. It's not a mistake. This is the way nature is. Or as one of my teachers used to say, \u201cIt's like looking at a waterfall and saying, praying to God, bowing everywhere. \u2018I want the water to flow up.\u2019 It's going to keep flowing down. That's the nature of water.\u201d The nature of flowers is to emerge, blossom, bloom, and then to wilt. You're new to this. Don't get involved with all this emptiness stuff yet.

And it was beautiful. It was very picturesque and everything. Ten years later, I was going back as a\u2026 chaperoning some other young people, and it was gone. It was\u2026. umbrellas on the beach. Everybody that sold out, they were gone. And friends of mine were also there were really hurt to hear about it, but this is what happened. Economics, not only nature, but economics does this. My town is torn down where I grew up, and I accept that stuff. But I can enjoy the memory of it without being attached or mournful. Or as you get older, you get a lot of good memories and some bad ones. But I can keep that memory without feeling\u2026 ","Larry: Okay. What's your question? ","Questioner: This attachment to emptiness. Is it\u2026 ","Larry: That village, excuse me? ","Questioner: That coldness, you know. Where everybody else is\u2026 ","Larry: I don't know. Do you feel coldness? Then you would feel cold. Someone wouldn't. I'm not legislating how you're supposed to feel at the end of this. But, the village as you knew it, that was the way it was empty of an enduring core. But, one way or another, it had to go through that, just as the flower did. The whole universe as we know it, the sun is not going to\u2013I don't know 2 trillion astronomers tell us, not astrology, they probably think they're here for, anyway. So we know that that's the way things are. But then when it comes to numero uno, me, somehow we go blank. We don't understand. Now, that's fine. You are comfortable with your village. Now, it evolved into something else which is not totally different, but it's also not the same. ","Break_line: So, in the language of the Buddha\u2013it's just technical language\u2013it was empty of an enduring core. It had no autonomous reality. It doesn't mean that it didn't exist or it was a hallucination. It existed as long as certain conditions held it together. The conditions changed. Just what happened now, there are certain conditions brought this terrorist thing that came together, more than we can figure out, that brought this to bear. And now there's no World Trade Center. And do you see what I'm getting at? ","Break_line: \u201cEmptiness sickness\u201d is when you get fixated on the nothingness of it all. And you disregard the fact that form is here to stay. And that our life is in the midst of forms that change. And the problem, the suffering isn't from the changing forms. The suffering is from our fixation. We hold on to things and then if they change, we have a hard time accepting it. And that's where the pain comes in. One more please. Please, you, yeah.

","Questioner: The concept of, like, how we say things about impermanence. ","Larry: Yes. ","Questioner: I\u2019m a Buddhist myself. ","Larry: You\u2019re from where? ","Questioner: I\u2019m from Thailand. ","Larry: Okay. ","Questioner: I've been hearing a lot of things about impermanence, and I try to think about it when things don't turn out to be the way I expect it to be. But sometimes when I try to be happy I also think of impermanence, and I know it's not going to be there with me all the time. So I don't understand how you can be happy if you think about impermanence. ","Larry: But I'm not saying think about impermanence. See, if I can tell you from the point of view of this practice. I mean, you know, I learned my stuff in Thailand. So who am I to tell you anything? It's in your blood. You could tell me a thing or two, I'm sure. There are two kinds of insights; I mentioned them. One is reflective, that's a skillful use of thought. And the other is direct seeing. So you know that things are impermanent. And sometimes in a way we talk to ourselves sort of like, \u201cOh of course, this had a change,\u201d and it helps ease things. Okay. But then it's not like what is being suggested here is we go around keep thinking \u201cimpermanent, impermanent.\u201d But you can learn that when happiness is there, you can enjoy it. And then when it's gone, it's gone. ","Break_line: Let me take a very simple example: sunset. Let's say there\u2019s a beautiful sunset. No one's saying you can't enjoy it. You're there, and it's just beautiful. So much in nature is, especially if the mind is clear. And you're appreciating the sunset and it goes down. Your heart is all warm, and it's beautiful. No suffering. Then the next day, you come running back to get it again. And it isn't the way it was. Or you start comparing it, \u201cin Acapulco was better than\u2026\u201d The first was joy. One way to talk about it was joy. The second was a quest for pleasure, where we try to get it. Now if you can allow yourself to be happy when it's there, knowing that of course it's not going to last forever. And while you're happy, you're happy. It's just a fact. And then it's gone. And then what's next is what's next. ","Break_line: Now there's a deeper place than happiness, unhappiness, happiness unhappy. And that's what Rumi's point. There's a place that isn't. The happiness you're talking about is subject to vicissitude. Change. Coming and going, rising and falling, praise and blame, healthy and sick, all those kind of things. If you can get comfortable with it, be with it, let it go. Be with it, let it go. It takes you to someplace; you could call it \u201ctrue happiness,\u201d that's deeper than whether you have good fortune or bad fortune. Good fortune must alternate with bad fortune. Good health and bad health, praise and blame, wealth and poverty, strength and weakness, all of those. If you don't believe me, check your life. Is there any of those qualities? You have them forever? I don't think so. But we're talking about something that never\u2026 anything that arises passes away. What the Buddhist saying is something that never was born, so it can't die. Okay, so it's not that you shouldn't be happy. But when you're happy, enjoy the happiness. And when it's gone, just know the truth of that, and be with what's next. That's the practice. Does that make sense? Okay, one more and then really we should\u2026 please.

And I'm glad that when they called us about what Buddhists think, that you refused; that they were trying to impose a tribe there. And my immediate reaction to 911 was feeling like I'm being asked to be part of this tribe, America; it's not my tribe. I want to find: who are my people? what is my country? And so I went to peace demonstrations immediately and people were talking about forgiveness and all of that. And I thought this is my tribe, on some level. And now I'm coming, as I'm stepping out of that, I'm realizing that's not right either. There's plenty of people who I can identify with who are not so sure that we should behave peacefully or whatever. I mean I don't necessarily agree with them, but they're not people I want to write off either. ","Larry: But you're into writing in and writing off. Go ahead. ","Questioner: Yeah I know, I noticed that in myself. But it's also very much, if you go out and demonstrate for peace, you will find that you are put or even talk to people about forgiveness. Suddenly that costs in a way that. ","Larry: Well, that's what other people do to you right? ","Questioner: Right. ","Larry: Okay. But I'm talking about inner stability. Let's play this back. I love America. I honestly do. I had a flag hanging from my window; that probably disappoints you, sorry. I love it. I served in the military for two years willingly. I was drafted but I didn't bear arms because I didn't believe in it. But I did believe in serving my country. I love this country. I am immensely grateful for what it's, my heritage is one of my family. I grew up knowing what my parents went through to get here. I'm from immigrant background, so I know\u2026 and then I've traveled a lot. I love this. That doesn't mean that I don't care about other countries. Just like a person who has self-respect doesn't mean that they're not compassionate. They may be more compassionate with someone else because they feel stable. So I think the art is not even being in a tribe. ","Questioner: Yes. ","Larry: When it becomes an identity tightly held over and about. You see, we do it for security. You were looking for a new tribe so you'd feel secure. And everyone's doing that, and then we create insecurity; it backfires. So, \u201cI'm a Jew! I'm a Palestinian!\u201d And then, \u201cWell, why do you do that?\u201d \u201cBecause I want to belong. These are my people. I go back. I have my history.\u201d I know that one well. Okay, then the Palestinians have their own, \u201cGod said this desert. No, God said so\u2026\u201d The problem isn't in being a Palestinian and loving your culture and the food and all that. It's just sort of like I'm 5\u20199\u201d and a half. The problem is, it becomes a fixation, and it gets set. It's dualistic. It gets set up over and above whatever opposite you want to make: peacenik, warmonger. And that's what the mind, until it gets free, is doing. ","Questioner: Yeah. I think we're kind of entering a period that feels very McCarthyist and very dualistic, where people\u2013I don't know, that's just been my experience. ","Larry: You can make whatever analogies you want. I lived. Were you alive when the McCarthy thing was happening? ","Questioner: I wasn't. ","Larry: I was. ","Questioner: But I'm just saying it just feels very different now to speak about forgiveness than it did. ","Larry: This one is a challenge to all of us because I'm not for violent responses. But in this one, the problem with the violence is that it's so conditioned in you, all the societies. When something goes wrong, that's all we think of is, \u201cWe got to hit back.\u201d We don't think, \u201cIs there anything else we could do?\u201d Now, in terms of this, if you're the head of a country, any country, and someone kills 5,000 let's say\u2013now, they say it's less; it doesn't make the pain less. Let's say, of your citizens, do you think, what would Gandhi do? Would he go on a fast? Do you think the terrorists care if he fasts? This is a different kind of, we don't know where the enemy is. It's not bound\u2026 to pause and say, \u201cI don't know.\u201d ","Break_line: What I hope is that all the oxygen isn't taken up by war as the solution, so that there's some oxygen left to try to understand what got us here. Like, re-examine our foreign policy, especially in the Middle East. Re-examine the impact we have on other people because of the tremendous wealth we have and et cetera et cetera. Not to blame America but to try to understand that this didn't come out of chicken liquor, whatever. It didn't just drop from the sky. What is that? Chicken. Chicken Little. ","Break_line: The Buddhist scheme is very logical. It\u2019s causes and effect, causes and effect. So, wisdom is to try to say, \u201cWell, how did I contribute to these causes?\u201d In your case, same as an individual, \u201cThat now have gotten me into this mess in here where people hate me so much? Oh, I'm just a total saint and they hate me.\u201d Maybe. Some innocent people have been killed because they belong to a certain. But we're talking about inner work. If you want to be free, you can be\u2026 love America and not be a problem to the world. And unless your love of America is such that it makes everyone else\u2013you're into superior and inferior\u2013you also care more if an American dies than if an Afghani dies et cetera et cetera. ","Break_line: Being in a tribe seems very human. We humans seem to love to be in a tribe and then we feel secure. The problem is the security makes us insecure because everyone else is doing it and then we fight with each other, and then it backfires. Are the Israelis better off? Are the Palestinians better off? I doubt it. 50 years or however long it's been going on. Anyway. Blah blah blah. Have a good Thanksgiving. ","Break_line: Let's pause for one moment. I don't know how you feel maybe some of your personal life or what's happened. Disappointment? I don't know. But the Buddhist way is... Here\u2019s a very humble teaching from Thailand, from a forest teacher. Let's say you get a mango and there's a worm in it. You can throw the whole mango out or you can enjoy the rest of the mango. Put it in other terms: It's a good idea during Thanksgiving, whether you don't feel American or you do feel American, is there anything to give thanks for? I think you will find, is there anything right with your life? Is there anything right with America? You may have to do some forgiving, I don't know. So, you don't have to throw the whole mango out. I'm sure that no matter how you are feeling about this, you could find some things that are good about yourself, about the world. And you can enjoy the mango.

Yeah. ","Questioner: Because when things happen I look toward myself as the cause of the suffering because of clinging or expectations or whatever.

And you said this in part of your talk about the people who look externally to the other place to find the reason why they're suffering. If they keep doing with different people or in different circumstances. Essentially like mankind has done the same way of solving the problems of looking at the problems. Now you can't really look to advise people of what to do. You should go to the CIMC; that will straighten you out. But it's hard in the relationship that I'm talking about to sit idly by and not trying to make that person more conscious about the need to do what you talked about tonight. ","Larry: Yes. It's very common with all of us. In fact, one of the things, over the years I've spoken to many couples, and it's very common for one person to be a meditator and the other one isn't. My wife is not a meditator. I'm vegetarian. She's not. There's a whole long list of things. She's born in Russia. I was born here. She doesn't know the most obvious. So what the heck are we doing together? Can a meditator and a non-meditator live happily together? What I found is the key thing is respect. Now I'm going to get to what you're asking. That is, you have to respect this other person's right to not be as wise as you by coming to CIMC, et cetera. I am being a little bit sarcastic, but you understand. And, of course, for a friendship to happen or a marriage or a partnership, they have to respect your right to do this kind of work. Then I've seen it work. When it becomes a political football, it doesn't work out too well. ","Break_line: So what to do? Because certainly I'm not exempt. Sometimes I see ways in which people I love: my sister, she doesn't have these resources and she has no interest at all in developing them. Every time we visit with each other, should we go through the same exchange? \u201cLarry, what is this meditation?\u201d And my wife has told me, \u201cDon't go through it.\u201d So about ten or I'll go through a whole long thing, a mini dharma talk, and she'll look very interested, and it'll go wheee-whooo. And then the next time, it's the very same thing. She's not interested. ","Break_line: But here's the piece that might be of some help. It has helped me and certainly some other people. You have a reaction to these people, people who are, let's say, it's one person in particular. Okay. You have a reaction and that reaction, you can't help that reaction: You feel badly for them. You feel impatient. You feel frustrated, whatever you feel. But, in a given moment, instead of trying to make the ideal Buddhist action or compassionate action or whatever is so good, focus in on your reaction: that it's bothering you; that it's frustrating; that you're annoyed with the person; that you feel sorry. Whatever is you're feeling, from moment to moment. It's not thinking about it. They come in your presence, and you can see what's happening, and you have a reaction. ","Break_line: Now the reaction is mechanical. It comes out of your conditioning. Okay? So, if you're aware of the reaction\u2013and a lot of practice in daily life is just that. It's becoming aware of our reactivity, which is automatic. It comes out of our upbringing, our school system, our wounds, our joys, et cetera. If you're aware of it\u2013that doesn't mean trying to eliminate it\u2013but you're aware of it, little by little it loses its power, and then that creates a space. In that space, I don't know what you should say or do. Maybe nothing. But I have greater faith in the clear mind that replaces the reactivity because out of that comes what you could call a response. A response is not mechanical. ","Break_line: And sometimes, for example, here's one thing I had to learn with my wife. She would come home. She works in a hospital with a lot of very elderly sick Russians who are in pain and complaining and et cetera. And then she comes home. And then at times she'll start and then I have a beautiful dharma talk to give her. And that's not what she wants. She just wants me to listen. And it took me I don't know two or three years. I finally learned. I said, \u201cOh duh, you're not interested in my immense storehouse of wisdom. What you would like is to just be a person who cares to listen to her.\u201d And I talked it to her, and she says, \u201cYes! that's exactly what.\u201d So that was hard for me to learn how to do that because I'm in the fixing things business. ","Break_line: But I've learned that now what might come out of the new space that you create by taking care of the reaction\u2013it gets weaker and weaker as you do that\u2013is maybe it's silence. Maybe you say the same thing that you've been saying for a few years, but the energy is different, and the person is much more able to listen. Or maybe you ask a fresh question to them that never occurred to you before. I don't know. But I trust that space. That's the beginner's mind that some of you have read about. The \u201cdon't know\u201d mind. It's the freshness rather than coming out of all of our formulas and recipes for what would be good for that. Do you see what I'm getting at? ","Questioner: The reason that I asked for this kind of insight into how to help this person\u2013that's my desire, to try to help\u2013is that I haven't said anything. I haven't reacted. I created that exact space and I'm kind of drawn back from it. I do understand how I feel. ","Larry: But you're having the reaction inwardly anyway. Otherwise, it sounds like it. Sounds like a lot of frustration there. ","Questioner: I see that there have been so many decisions that have been made that have been very hurtful, the outcomes that he wanted. ","Larry: I got it. I understand. But I'm sorry to interrupt. ","Questioner: There are other people involved in the life that are going to get caught on a crossfire, like a spaghetti western. The same kind of themes over and over. ","Larry: Okay, but here's what I'm saying. The fact that you restrain yourself, that's one extreme. The other extreme is a person just reacts verbally, all the time or physically. The other is you restrain yourself, but the reactivity is still going on, and it's building up in you. And you want something else. Whether you express it verbally or physically or not, practice with the reactivity. That opens the mind up. I don't know what's next, but you're in a better position. Here's what I found. There's a better chance of what comes out of your mind, maybe even depicting your view of what's going on with other people, that is kinder and wiser. But no guarantees.

Start living your life, and your body will take care of the rest.\u201d Which sounds simplistic. And he really said I'm not telling you to never have the surgery. I'm just telling you to immerse yourself in life and in the problems of living a little bit more and see what happens. And so, I'm hearing him say that and I'm hearing you say, \u201cWalk the walk. Full catastrophe living.\u201d ","Larry: Don't make it so black and white. I'm not a medical expert. You may need to have the surgery, despite what this other person said. I honestly don't know. And I'm not sure this other person knows. They may be correct, sometimes. But look here's\u2026 let's start with the fact that you enjoy coming to the safety of, let's say, a CIMC and places like it. It's nice to have an oasis somewhere in this world which sometimes feels awfully barren, a nice place. I don't mean to discredit that. And everyone, personally, I have learned I wasn't always so tolerant. I've learned to respect everyone's path as quite unique and also what you want from the practice. And one person may just want that. Some of that will spill over into daily life anyway. It has to. You have more energy; you're a little bit more optimistic; you see a little bit more clearly. But the full wisdom practice takes advantage of that. Keep doing it, by all means, if you like. Do more of it. But if you attach to it, then you create a separation between that and then the rest of life. And, if that works for you, I'd be quite surprised. I know. So that it's not one versus the other. ","Break_line: For example CIMC was started\u2013I'm just giving you my account because I started, guilty of starting this place\u2013because having done lots of long silent retreats in Asia and here, I mean months on end, and seeing that people, including myself, we would become very intoxicated with the tremendous peace and joy of leaving all of this stuff behind and just going off to some beautiful mountain in Korea or Japan or wherever or here and a Barre and just with nice people and silence and no one can become a pain in the whatcha-ma-call-it for each other. And that was great and a lot got accomplished. And I also noticed that when we\u2019d come off, that people would then, life would be devoted to earning enough money to go back for the next long retreat and wearing those retreats like combat ribbons. Sort of Desert Storm, Iraq, three-month retreat of 1983, five months in Korea, et cetera. Wearing them down here and most of life is passing them by. It's possible to be non\u2026 it's a kind of non-hospitalizable schizophrenia. It doesn't work, in short. ","Break_line: Unless you are\u2013look, there are people who are born contemplatives. I've spent time with a few, a hermit in Korea. They live out their whole life in a cave. They're not coming back. They are incredibly happy there. Okay. Now I did my best to draw out this person; they're practicing in the cave. How many people here want to live out the rest of their life in the cave? I don't think so. Okay now, a second hermit I spent time with. It's good that he was in his cave. It was a hut, way up in the mountains, because he was unbearably neurotic and to inflict him on people. And also they couldn't live with him. So he knew enough to stay out of trouble by being with\u2026 The first guy was really at peace. You have to find your own way. But the fact is most of your life is going to be lived with people, isn't it? Right. Okay. This is the crucial. I'm sorry I didn't have time to get to this. ","Break_line: Many spiritual paths including this, in my opinion, are very colored by the monastic approach which has dominated Buddhism for thousands of years. Okay. In that approach, the main people - not exclusively, they've always been lay people who've lived full lives with families and all the rest and have also gotten enlightened\u2013but predominantly, there's been monks, mainly monks and some nuns, who have lived a very specialized life. And, when that and they've gotten into that because maybe all of us come to this practice because of relationship. We're wounded. Relationship is a battlefield whether it's nations with each other or religions with each other or us with each other, partners with each other, et cetera. We don't seem to know how to do that. That's what I was trying to say. So let's get out of here. Let's go off to a mountain to a cave or get lost in activities. But we don't seem to understand the importance of learning. ","Break_line: For example, one of my wonderful teacher named I'd rather not use his name. And he would talk about lay life this way say like, \u201cWell, there's all this suffering I hear about marriage. And, in spite of that, all these lay people, they just jump up and volunteer for the job.\u201d And then some of the younger ones, because I lived with monastics, celibate and so forth. I've never been a monk, but I have spent extended periods of time living in that community and living like them temporarily. And it's very functional for them to see relationship as, \u201cIt's hopeless. Everything is hopeless. The planet is hopeless. Sex is ridiculous,\u201d because that justifies the choice they've made. It makes it easier for them to remain celibate, ie. \u201cI ain't missing anything.\u201d Okay, so it's functional for them. They've made a choice. And for some of them, it works out beautifully. Not for all. People have romantic views about monks or nuns. Some use that, they're born for it in my opinion. ","Break_line: Okay, so here we are. If we are lay people\u2013and we're not just here to support, to give food, medicine, clothes, and shelter to the people who are really doing it\u2013we want to do it ourselves. We want to suffer less. We don't want to just chant and bow to famous monks and then go home feeling that we're blessed and taken care of. I haven't seen that work too much. Although you may believe in it. I don't. Okay, so we can't run away from relationship. We have no choice because our life is made up of relationship. So we need a new attitude, a totally different attitude. And it exists in dharma. Sort of a bad situation is a good situation. Or, another way of putting it is, that by which we humans fail is also that by which we can succeed. But it's a radical change in attitude. ","Break_line: You have to start seeing that the very difficulty of, let's say work or relationship or whatever it is for you, you have to really take it on. And you're going to make mistakes and you're going to fail over and over again. But you have to understand, I've been at it for a while. I hope I'm to some degree walking my talk. Am I completely walking my talk? Probably not. I don't know if anyone can. It's hard, but is a tremendously rich relationship as a teacher to yourself if you're willing to learn and not just stuck in being right all the time and learning how to apologize and how to more and more. ","Break_line: Because my problem\u2013there's only one problem that I have\u2013and that problem is Larry. It would be a much better world without Larry. Much better, certainly for me and for anyone in my world. So I'm working on. But you can't kill it if I try to kill Larry. That's just the ego saying, \u201cAll right, you want to kill Larry? Great. I'll do whatever you want as long as I run the joint.\u201d That's the ego. It's brilliant. So it's more getting to understand it and sort of taking some of the power out of it. And even some of the thrusts in life need a kind of centered ego. It's fine. We don't have to crucify ourselves, the wrong choice. But anyway. ","Break_line: So yes, but maybe re-enter slowly, pick on something, like some difficulty you have. But some people just don't do that. And I can just tell you what I think. I think we have no choice since most of our life is relationship. But if you decide you just want to give your best to sitting at home and sitting here and going to retreat centers and then the heck with this. It's your life. It's fine with me. So that everyone relates to it to the degree to which they can. ","Break_line: I'm with the Greeks. I think it's Socrates, I'm pretty sure. He said the main question we face is \u201cHow is one to live?\u201d Each of us face that question: how are we to live? And we've been brought up, this is how you should live. And then, mindlessly, we just do it. Typically if you really start to go into this, you've broken from that. You realize you start to look at something that has been taken for granted. You haven't examined it because you don't realize how much of it has just been handed to you from your parents, the school system, the culture, and so forth. And maybe it's fine and you keep doing it but in a different way. And maybe it isn't how you want to live at all but the question never goes away. How is one to live? And this is designed to help us do that but not in an abstract way. ","Break_line: You start by how do we actually live? How do you actually live? How do I actually live? And you start there and you end there. The first step is the last step because it keeps being like that. It's not like you become perfect. Maybe some people become perfect. I haven't met them yet. Some are called great masters, great gurus. I didn't see it. But I'm from Brooklyn and we're warped. Missouri too, I think. I'm from Missouri. Never saw\u2026 Anyone here from Missouri? I don't want anyone to sue me. Wrong speech and all that. It's a compliment actually. I'm bragging. Okay, but you see what I'm getting at? It's up to you. But I think don't throw away the good part. ","Break_line: Now, then you're still left with should I undergo surgery or not? Okay, look I don't know. No but I'm exploring how you might help yourself answer it. First of all, your friend gave you this advice and that must bring up something in you. Maybe it's a relief. Then, \u201cOh great, I don't have to do surgery. I just have to go out and do that.\u201d And then maybe when you go out and do that, you see that, wow! that's really hard to do. And then you say, \u201cMaybe I should do surgery.\u201d You could spend months going back and forth. ","Break_line: Okay, we all have the same mind. So, what you may find out is that also if you have fear of doing the surgery, face that fear. Because then you may be all that eager to hear all kinds of advice that enable you to not do the surgery when you really should. I have no idea. That's what I meant by I trust a clear mind. Whatever comes out of that much more than any friend, even well-meaning. It's your decision; it's your life. And if you see your reactivity to the surgery, to his or her suggestion, et cetera, there's a clearer space that emerges. That's what our practice is about. And I trust what can come out of that, the decision. But life is big.

Well, it's all we have. There's nothing else. And now has infinite depth. So the practice is really more and more preferring to live in the now, which is a fact, then all kinds of stuff about an imaginary future or some reconstructed past. And that means just living for living's sake. And the learning that comes out of that does liberate you. So you don't have to have this big program. I'm here. Is this freeing me? Is that freeing me?

","Larry: I don\u2019t know. ","Questioner: I tend to think it\u2019s more meditation. But I don\u2019t know the difference, I guess. ","Larry: Yes. No. Well put. There's a difference between, in a way, what we were doing in the first part, where you're mindful of the breath, where the main thing you're being asked to do is to be with the object. And then there's something else, which is, in addition to being mindful of the object or the situation, are you discerning about it? Are you seeing what's going on? Wisdom has to\u2026 we, more and more, have to be informed by wisdom. Our life has to\u2026 wisdom has to become our best friend. The chitta has to start listening to what wisdom is and acting on behalf of wisdom. Let me be a little bit more clear. Let's say, there's so many different forms. Let's say there's chanting, ceremonies, listening to a tape, let's say music, listening to a tape about, what, being a mountain? ","Questioner: Or tapes that have songs about mountains in them, words about mountains and spirituality. ","Larry: Okay. Some of that. What effect does that have on you when you listen to it? ","Questioner: Very calming. ","Larry: Right, exactly. Okay, now, if you just do that then it's just relaxation which is necessary, especially if you're very tense, which many of us are. But insight meditation, Vipassana, is more than calm and relaxation. In fact, if you've been doing this you know that sometimes it creates stress. It's not just stress reduction because when you start looking at certain things you say, \u201cOh my God, I thought I'm a nonviolent disciple of Gandhi. I'm Adolph Hitler. Why didn't my friends tell me this?\u201d And there's anguish. ","Break_line: So, it's not just about relaxing but we spent a lot of time on that aspect and many things can help you: listening to nice, that music, certain phrases, chanting can help concentrate and calm the mind. Wisdom is kind of drawing the significance out of what's happening to you, drawing it out of that. But the calmness helps you do that. In other words, once the mind gets calmer, it becomes more clear. So it can see. It's like having a prescription. Let's say you have glasses and finally you have the right prescription. So calming is nice, and it's part of the journey. But from the point of view of this practice, it's not the whole thing. ","Break_line: And so, if it helps you some days you come home and let's say you feel very upset. And if that is calming, that's very good. But if you don't look at why you're upset, ever, then it won't go away. It's just going to be an alternation between calming and upset. Calming and upset. We already know how to do that. You get very upset. You're in the refrigerator. That calms you down, takes your mind off the problem. Very upset. Let's go to a movie. Very upset. Call a friend. Very upset. Dive into a book. So this is not new. We've offered something else the breath which can be misused too. The breath can calm you down, I hope you know. And if you get fixated on that then you will deprive yourself of a certain other kind of riches which comes from learning. And that's what we call wisdom. Does that make sense? ","Questioner: It does now. What you just said at the end really hit home for me. ","Larry: Yes. It's a form if I could put it in another language: it's a form of self-reeducation, where, finally, you are the teacher and the student; life is really the teacher. Life is constantly tireless, never stops teaching. Things are happening. There's a lesson in everything that's happening, if nothing else. In this practice, impermanence is a very important teaching. We didn't have enough time to give it, as much time as it deserves, because it opens up into so much. We can just hint at it. Well life is constantly teaching and everything. Life is impermanent. Life is impermanent. But there aren't enough students. The curriculum is unfolding. The course is going on, but no one seems to want to go to class. So here we have to like, \u201cHey, life is impermanent. You better learn that because it affects everything you're doing. And if you learn it, you can really live a lot better.\u201d Yeah, it's learning. But don't throw away the calmness part. That's good too.

And over time you learn how to take care of yourself best, but for example just staying within the confines of what we know here. If I sat down and I felt, you know what I in fact do almost all the time, before I turn to the breath, I mentioned it here and in some of the discussion groups. And I certainly would do that if I felt let's say very agitated or the mind\u2019s all over the place, instead of going to the breath, step number one is I would acknowledge what my starting point is. \u201cOh look at that. I don't want to meditate. I hate being here. I feel so restless. I'm ready to punch a hole in the wall. And they want me to sit here and just quietly, what, smile and be with my breath? I don't want to do that.\u201d And sometimes what happens is you see what your starting point is, resistance, restlessness, and so forth. Somehow the mind appreciates that, just that you know what's going on, and it subsides a wee bit. And then you can turn to the breath. ","Break_line: Sometimes, especially as you go on in this practice, maybe you have to look at the problem directly right off, with a limited amount of concentration you have because there's no way you can be with the breath, you try. Or, you can use other tools which we didn't emphasize but which were brought up by some of you: counting the breath, for example, if the mind's thinking a lot, it's obsessed. It's got lots of thoughts. Well and give it something to nibble on. Give it a thought, a skillful thought like counting. One person mentioned 1-2-3-4-5 or if you get better out of the ten on the out breath or on both. It could be in one, out one: 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, or a simple in out, in out, in out. And there are many other phrases. In the Thai Forest Tradition, they would teach us buddho. Buddho means the one who knows. It's another name for the Buddha. So on the in breath, Buddho, Buddho, Buddho. In addition to reminding you that you are the Buddha, it can be helpful. And sure things like yoga and other, taking a warm bath, or just taking a nice walk outside.

And I\u2019m really just curious if you have any insights about how to deal with these kinds of people. ","Larry: Well that's a big one. Yes. I wouldn't be so arrogant as to say that I can give you bluup, a little answer, and you're all set now because we all have a lot of that in different forms in life. But a few things come to mind. It's good that you're starting to experience more calm. Is that what you said? Inner peace? What was the word you used? ","Questioner: Yeah, peacefulness. ","Larry: Yeah. Okay. Understand that if you keep practicing, that gets deeper. That is a form of nourishment. Finally, when you can drop into a still mind when the mind is really still and let's say, even if you're there for a minute or 30 seconds, sometimes you can really feel when you come out of it. It's like having a nice rest. I'm not exaggerating. When the mind gets very still, that means nothing's happening. There's no thinking or very little. Other thoughts are like snowflakes with no potency. You just come through. And you learn how to often when we get into that stillness, we fight it because we're afraid of it or we're not used to it. You learn how to really allow yourself to just bathe in it, to bathe in that stillness. And you begin to see that the stillness is not nothing. Sometimes people say, \u201cWell, nothing's happening.\u201d The truth is it's charged with aliveness, the stillness. And if you can allow yourself to take that on then you have more energy to bring to those people who are wanting stuff from you in the way in which only you know.

Some of what is tiring you is that you have expectations of it being other than the way it is. You want them to not want things from you. Perhaps you want them to become meditators and great bodhisattvas and start doing yoga and organic food and maybe they don't want to do that. Do you see what I'm getting at? So, look at your start\u2026 some of the problem is, it's complex. Sometimes with friends, you outgrow friends. And in my own life there have been some very painful times where you love a person. You went all through, in my own case there was a group of us. We all went to University of Chicago together. We were like a family. And then I was the only one who turned in this direction and, little by little, they started being annoyed with me and \u201cAsian bullshit\u201d they would call it and \u201cstill doing that Asian crap.\u201d They didn't know what it was.

This is hard to answer because if both people are on the path, they can help each other. For example, the one who's less out of control can say, \u201cWhat's happening right now. Where are we?\u201d This is all new AG\u2019s, isn't it? What I mean is we can do that. But let's say, now from the point of view of an individual. Let's say you pick up on, you've lost it, you're out of control. And that happens a lot in relationship. But at a certain point perhaps you come in contact with it. It's not that you have to follow your breathing. It's that just to remember that you're out of control. You just notice it has a breaking quality to it. It slows it down and then as you begin to investigate you may even do something. Let's say one teacher suggested, and it's a very good practice. Some of you have heard of her, Vimala Thakar, who's come to our center off and on. What she said is supposing it's all over, and you have blown it. She said it's a very good practice to go back to the person and apologize. Just say, \u201cYou know, I just realized that was all wrong. I mean I was just defending myself.\u201d And it may be an hour later or maybe two days later, you go and you apologize. It's hard for us to do, but it has a very wonderful effect.

As the practice develops, what people tend to notice is that you pick up on the onset of, let's say it's aggression or a fight about to have, you start to feel like the irritability, like back there. You just feel like you feel some movement of the neck or\u2026 you catch it before it's full blown. That is one thing that happens with practice. You begin to see that. The other is\u2013and this to me is the main one\u2013as the mind gets more calm, it gets harder and harder to bear a false note. In other words, if you're wanting to be right in the process of bullying someone and then there's a bit of quiet. And if you're doing this practice, you know it. It's just hard to escape. The other person doesn't even have to bring it up. You just realize what you said was off. What you're doing is you see why you're doing it, and you pick up from where you are. I mean you start right there. It's of course very helpful if both people are committed to a genuine dialogue.

Now you're outraged about something. Now, in that moment, are you helping the problem of pollution?, let's say. Especially if this is a recurring thing. Now, every now and then, we all do it. But if the person is in the habit of feeling very, very bad about the way the world is then I feel this practice can be tremendously helpful. ","Break_line: First of all, what have they accomplished? Nothing. That is, they're not joining Greenpeace. They're not going out and helping in some way so that there's a dissatisfaction, they're going to do something about it. If it doesn't work, at least they've done something about it. What they're doing is just commenting on how bad it is and getting depressed. So they've added one more casualty to the world. Now whatever the number of casualties, it's 10 billion plus one, and nothing's improved. There isn't any less toxin in the world. And now there's one more toxic person in the world. I don't see the point. So that, it seems to me, what the option the person has is seeing through it. Again, it's not to say how great everything is, but what is to be added by our personal depression in that way because it's a kind of helplessness. It is really going to the root of our sense of helplessness. And either doing something about it or releasing ourselves from something that is futile because it's not really amounting to anything. This is just the way I feel about it. ","Break_line: Now in the process, you are doing something about that because one of the main ways in which we all bring toxins into the world is by just loading our moods on top of each other. Now if this person could actually be happy; the Dalai Lama is happy. Anyone who's met him knows he's a happy man in the midst of a catastrophe. And it doesn't mean he doesn't do anything about it because he's extremely dedicated to the political situation of the Tibetans. It doesn't mean that you have to be depressed to work hard. For example, the Buddha and Jesus led revolutions that are still going on now. And the work didn't come just out of anger. It came out of love. So that if you're spending a lot of time hating what's going on and feeling terrible about it, I think the practice can be very, very helpful. ","Break_line: Again it's not to be complacent. We all do need to do something for this world. And one thing to do is of course as one Vietnamese Buddhist monk put it is: to be peace. If you want a peaceful world, start with yourself. Again, so that's eliminating certain sentimentalities that are really not so helpful where we somehow feel so sad about what's going on. Again, we can't help but feel that because there's enough reason to. But if it's something that's going on a lot, I think it really should be investigated and see what that really is. Sometimes we use these outer things as an occasion for us to be depressed about something else that's bothering us.

The first one is\u2026 Why don't I just string them together and you can choose which one you like. When you\u2019re sitting on the cushion and a mood comes up, and you almost experience it as pure energy\u2013you don\u2019t know why it\u2019s there or where it\u2019s coming from, and you can\u2019t attach all your stuff to it. But today, I was experiencing restlessness, and I was investigating it, and then I just kind of couldn\u2019t go any further. ","Larry: What does further mean? ","Questioner: Well, I was kind of getting sucked into the restlessness. ","Larry: So then you weren\u2019t aware anymore. ","Questioner: Wait a minute. ","Larry: Sorry. ","Questioner: I was trying to go back to the breath. It was like going back to the breath. It was like investigating the restlessness, I thought, \u201cOh geez, my heart\u2019s beating.\u201d But I was finding it kind of. I just think you have some. What do you do when you hit kind of that stucky place? The thing is starting to take you over and you're trying to investigate and then you go back to the breath but it's kind of got you anyway. And then I feel like I just sort of lose it. Whatever samadhi I've got or whatever it is, it just kind of collapses. ","Larry: Yeah, be simpler. In other words, we can\u2019t\u2026 it's like a burden that you've put on yourself to get the perfect samadhi, to get back to the breath, to not be restless. The best help is a different attitude with much more space around the whole event. Let's say a mood comes upon you and it's restlessness, and then you investigate it. Now what does that mean to you: investigate? ","Questioner: I try to see where it is in my body. I try to investigate the sensations. But, this is precisely my question. I experience that as difficult. While I'm experiencing the difficulty of the investigation, the thing is escalating. ","Larry: One rule of thumb: go back to the breath. ","Questioner: Just go back to the breath? ","Larry: Oh yes. Or, use the breath as a support while investigating; that, for some people, is extremely helpful. Have any of you tried that and found it helpful? A lot of practice is either you\u2019re with the breath or you're with restlessness. This is different. This is that the primary object is the restlessness because it's really obvious that that's what you should be with. It's taking over. Okay. So, while you're with those sensations which we're calling restless, in the background\u2013it kind of recedes in the background somewhat\u2013you feel the in breath and the outbreath. And there's something in the soothing quality of being with the breath while you're investigating a non-soothing object or an unpleasant object or a frightening object by staying in touch with the in-breath and the out-breath. So that if I had to put it into words, and this is paraphrasing the Anapanasati Sutta, the Buddha: Being fully aware of restlessness, the yogi breathes in. Being fully aware of restlessness, the yogi breathes out. It's simultaneous. They're happening together. And so sometimes that can be a big help. But if not, just go back to your samadhi practice. That would make the most sense.

I found myself using words that in the past were kind of\u2026 but they didn't feel judgmental. It was just obvious that\u2019s what I was doing. I was like, \u201cOh boy, I\u2019m having a whole conversation and I\u2019m just totally defended.\u201d So instead of saying\u2026 Is that okay? ","Larry: Well, it depends what you set for yourself. You see there's a specific practice, one very prominent school of Vipassana, Mahasi Sayadaw style, where you intentionally make mental notes for everything that's happening. But I don't feel that's what you're saying. It sounds like you're just thinking while it's all happening. ","Questioner: Well, I was realizing that I was carrying a conversation with someone, who wasn\u2019t there of course. But what I would be doing, whereas in the past I would have just said \u201cconversation\u201d or something and gone back to the breath. ","Larry: Here's what I need to know. Are you using that technique of making mental notes, what's happening? ","Questioner: Somewhat. ","Larry: You have to know what you're\u2026 every time you sit, it's very helpful to know what you're attempting to do. What have you set for yourself? If that's not clear, you're going to waffle all over the place. Because here's the difference. On one hand, it's a technique. You are intentionally, as something comes up, you apply a mental note to it. That's a very useful technique that's used. But if not, if the mind just thinks it, that's all right, it's not criminal, but that's part of the field of what we're observing. It's not something we're intentionally using to help us stay mindful. It's part of the field of what we have to be mindful of. Do you see what I'm getting at? So if you find that this is helpful, you might want to explore using this technique because it's a perfectly good one if you're drawn to it. ","Questioner: And if you were using that technique, it\u2019s ok to use work like \u201cdefending, judging\u201d... ","Larry: Well that's what the technique is. Then, when you do it, you have to be really sensitive if there isn't subtle judgment hiding inside, like \u201cdefending, judging,\u201d so that it sounds like it's a nice neutral technique. But really all it is is self-condemnation in disguise. ","Questioner: That\u2019s my question. It didn\u2019t feel judgmental, but\u2026 ","Larry: Didn\u2019t? ","Questioner: It didn\u2019t. ","Larry: Good. ","Questioner: But I\u2019ve never used those words before. It was a direct result of your talk about selfing where I was like, I felt seen more of how the self is showing itself up in all these different ways. But I wanted to check that, I was a little nervous about the words, that they could be judgmental, and it could be\u2026 ","Larry: Yeah. Okay. Again, here, the practice really is artful. There's a lot of free play for your own individual nature, for your own creativity. It's not a cookbook recipe. This is what you do: 1234, ABC. It really isn't. As you go on, you'll see that. Now at the beginning, we do have to more or less standardize. And it's more like learning a musical instrument or dance where you do standard things over and over and over again until you then go freely. You dance freely or play freely. So it's something like that. But a lot of the time, for example, it's not so much having: \u201cAm I selfing right now? Am I selfing?\u201d See that could become tedious. Then again you might set for yourself a particular period of time where you're very sensitive to that happening. But most of the time, it's not so much that you're thinking about \u201cAm I selfing or not?\u201d because if there's a flow, if the flow of mindfulness is keeping up with the flow of events, then you're not selfing. Because, if you recall, the whole danger is when we're not aware. ","Break_line: The I and mine constantly is born. It's born a lot. And I mean all the time during a typical day. It's dangerous when there's no awareness accompanying it. If it just comes up, then we know it. We just hear the mind claiming something, \u201cYes, I did that for him and I'm one\u2026\u201d Fine. And in the hearing of it\u2013in other words, if there's awareness accompanying this\u2013we're not trying to edit out. We can\u2019t; it would be exhausting. The things that are coming out of this heart are just amazing, what comes out of it. ","Break_line: But what we can do is learn to meet what surfaces\u2013and we never know what's going to turn up\u2013with full awareness. And, more and more, as we get better at doing that then what the ancients call taking the poison out of the snake. In other words, it's sort of something that sounds like it could be trouble, sort of a self-centered kind of thought. But because we're aware, there's no venom in, the snake goes \u201cshhshhhshhh.\u201d And it goes like that, but nothing happens. So, it's not dangerous. ","Break_line: And I would say a lot of the time, it's much simpler. It's not so much thinking. It's more like a parade. Have you ever seen, let's say, the newsreels in the Soviet Union? The nation showing its strength? It would be like the tanks go by. Let's say the heads of state are up high, and the tanks go by, and they salute. And then the soldiers with those steps, they go by, and there's a salute. And then the Navy marches by, and then salute. Then the army marches by and salute. And then, it's a parade. Everything comes up. Hi, there. There they go. It's not that different in the mind. As we see the mind representing itself as being this and that. Yeah, right. That goes. And then the next one. The next one. And it's a flow. The letting go at that point is just happening so easily. We're not getting stuck anywhere. ","Break_line: It's what someone called keep a non-abiding mind. A Chinese Zen master said \u201cKeep a non-abiding mind.\u201d And that's of course the fruit of the practice, a very high accomplishment is to keep a mind that can land on something but doesn't get stuck. It can just be with what's there while it's there. When it's gone, fine. And then it can be with whatever is next. And the letting go is more graceful. It's not sort of so bumpy, of having to analyze and think and ponder. And then, now and then though, we get an insight and maybe we pull back for a moment. I guess that's what selfing is. Look at that. I didn't realize it. And that could be helpful. And then we go back to a much more just open and easy, just more natural. Just let things happen. Let the mind just as we've been learning how to allow the breath to be natural, to just empty itself. If the breath wants to be long, let it be. If it wants to be shallow, let it be. Can we be in touch with the breath as it follows its nature? Can we be in touch with our mind as it follows its nature? ","Break_line: Now what you'll find is your ability to do this improves. And you're seeing impermanence, of course. That's what I'm talking about. You're seeing everything arise and pass away. Arise and pass away. You'll see that it's an immense healing to the mind, to the heart, to the being, whatever you want to call it. Because it's as if in allowing everything to go through, the mind purifies itself, it heals itself. And every time we grab onto something, or we go like that, then we have trouble. We're abiding somewhere. We made a home. This is where I am. We drop roots. Trouble, because you can't drop roots anywhere. In a world that's constantly changing, to grasp onto anything is an invitation to suffer; it makes no sense. In anticipation, maybe some of you are thinking, \u201cWell, okay this non-attachment stuff, sounds good. But what about relationship?\u201d Is anyone thinking that? No. You are thinking that. Yeah.

So they say, \u201cThis is a totally unrealistic teaching. What are these people saying? How can you love someone and be non-attached? It sounds so cold.\u201d That gets said to me a lot. Okay, our starting point, or let's say a healthy way of bringing the practice into a relationship in terms of this issue, is to not get too big for our britches, to not get ahead of ourselves. Because the truth is that, mainly, when we get involved, there's a lot of attachment. We were lonely. We meet someone. \u201cOh, thank God, finally.\u201d And there's a lot of attachment. We all know all the variations, the pulling away after the first few weeks. ","Break_line: But if we have an ideal of perfection\u2013in other words, what would it be like if the Buddha got married? It's not going to work out too well. But what can be done and is being done by actual people like ourselves is that when you're in a relationship, and granted that a fair amount of the energy has to do with insecurity and attachment because we're not perfect yet, you know. And of course, when we are, we may not want to be in a relationship, but I shouldn't say that because that's not good for business. \u201cYou mean, I'm going to become a nun or a monk out of this? I don't want to become a nun or a monk.\u201d No, I'm not saying you will unless you really want to. If you really do, then it won't be a problem. But that might be ten years from now, or 20 years from, 20 lifetimes from now. ","Break_line: But what's realistic is let's say for people like ourselves, we enter into a relationship. We start where we are. And where we are is there's attachment in it and possessiveness. And, we work with that. Now, it's best if both people are willing to work with each other. But even if it's only one person is on the path, there's no question that you can loosen that attachment up a bit. So it's not strangling you. It's just like a loose noose, just like hanging like that. And there's no question that you can become much less possessive, instead of like, \u201cWhere are you going? When are you coming back? How long are you going to be away?\u201d Instead of doing that, after a while we start to see, like, every time I do that it feels terrible to me, and then the other person hates it. \u201cI'll be right back. I can't wait to get out of here.\u201d ","Break_line: So again, it's your question. The letting go comes out of not kind of sprouting wings and just flying out of our attachment. But it comes from really getting to know what attachment is, really taking the time and the trouble and it takes courage and patience. It's not easy. It's to really understand \u201cOh, this is what attachment\u2019s like.\u201d ","Break_line: And an image came to me some years ago. I still find it helpful. You know a fly on fly paper? It's like stuck. Now, let's say one thing is you try to free yourself from the attachment, and you tear your wings. It doesn't work. The other thing is this is the approach of Vipassana. The approach of Vipassana is, \u201cOh look at that. I can't move this arm, and the head turns about a 10th of an inch, and the back doesn't move at all, does it?\u201d And you feel that. You go into what is attachment anyway, not as some ideology but\u2026 and it's suffering. We see that when we're holding on like that or going like that, it is not a good way to live. So that, out of that, may grow a genuine letting go. It comes out of intelligence not out of an ideology. ","Break_line: The Buddha said you shouldn't be attached. Okay, I won't be attached. And you rip your wings. It's not that. It's out of understanding. The Buddha also talks so often, over and over and over again, about the importance of understanding, of wisdom; not to do things blindly; not to do things because just some teacher told you to do; or even the Buddha said; not because I told you to do it. Investigate, learn, understand the laws of nature. We're part of nature. And then out of that comes the strength. Understanding has tremendous momentum and power. Yes.

","Questioner: I am looking for suggestions on ways of working with boredom at work. But also, in the practice\u2013you talked about it today\u2013you were talking about resistance to boredom. I\u2019ve been working with that since then, but I can still feel that boredom. I can barely get through the breath, the in and out breath. And I don\u2019t even want to go into the next one. And I feel stuck in that. ","Larry: What do you want to do? Do you want to find something interesting to do? There is nothing interesting here. I mean for while you're here. Okay. I don't think it's different. Let's say the boredom here or the boredom at work. The difference is that we have a much better, we have controlled conditions here, so that we can really get to learn about boredom. But boredom is quite fascinating, by the way. It is. It's not boring at all if you're willing to look at it. ","Break_line: So step number one is, let's say, suppose as you just said, you feel bored. Okay. Let's say there was a miniature interviewer inside of your head while you're at work. And it would say to you, \u201cHow do you know that you're bored?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean, how do I know that I'm bored?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, you just said you're bored. How do you know?\u201d \u201cWell, okay, I'm droodling, whatever it is drooling. Doodling, I\u2019m doodling. My foot\u2019s tapping. I'm <sigh> looking at my watch. The content of my mind is, I feel dull, unhappy. There's a gray quality to everything. My mind is fantasizing about all kinds of other exciting things. I'd rather be golfing or whatever else.\u201d Okay, fine. Then that's what you try to watch again. The fly caught on the fly paper is you bring your attention to exactly what you're feeling because that's the truth in the moment. The truth is you're bored, right? Now, it doesn't have to be a condemnation on bored. ","Break_line: Now, for many of us, one of the reasons we have such a hard time with it is because we've been brought up to never be bored. We always have to be very creative and self-reliant and have all these endless projects. But sometimes, we're bored. So, can you open your heart to boredom? Can you allow boredom in because that's what's happening to you? That's the truth. It's not to fight with it, to try to replace it with what you think would be interesting. Now as you know, often, we hate boredom. We just don't like what it feels like. \u201cOh no, here comes boredom. I just hate feeling that way.\u201d Okay so then you look at the resistance. It's not that you try to force the mind to get back to the boredom but really what's prominent at this point is not boredom. It's resistance to boredom. It's that you just don't want to feel those feelings. And it's that you slip in under and feel. You try to learn what it feels like to not, to hate boredom. Do you see what I'm getting at? The restlessness? No good. ","Questioner: So what you\u2019re suggesting is to be with the resistance of the boredom, to feel it in the body. ","Larry: Wherever it is, the body is often easier to do because sometimes in the mind, it's so powerful. The mind casts a spell and we get caught up. But the body is more accessible. That's not what you want. You want a different answer though, right? ","Questioner: I thought I was trying to do that. I felt like it was driving me deeper into the boredom. ","Larry: We see. Okay, now we have a problem: is that you want to get rid of boredom. You see, it got me in deeper. I thought this technique would get me out of boredom. Think of awareness more as an aesthetic. You know what has helped me a lot is the attitude towards observation is more like a naturalist. Let's say someone who loves birds or who loves to see the sunrise, sunset, or loves to watch the ocean or looking at beautiful art or listening to beautiful music. It's not so instrumental; just grasping it, just experiencing it, just as it is. Now one of the reasons it's so hard for us and why we don't see in quotes \u201cresults\u201d from our observation is because we're trying to get results with our observation. We're trying to use observation as a ray gun. It's sort of like to shoot down boredom. And especially, you've heard like, well if you're really aware, the boredom you'll see through it. You'll see it's impermanent. It lacks ownership. There's no self. It falls away. Oh great. And then you aim your awareness towards the boredom, and it just gets stronger. Okay. But you have to\u2026 ","Break_line: Part of the problem for most of us is we don't know how to observe. That is, we've been brought up to observe with some instrumental value. That is, we observe to make money; or we observe to get make a deal; or we observe to something in it for us. We don't know the art of pure observation: to just see for the joy of it, just to see for its own sake. It's like learning for its own sake. Just to see, what is boredom?, to really investigate it in a sense of the openness of a scientist, of a real scientist. Now, if you can learn to do that. And again, what you have to see is when you're not doing that. You'll come to pure observation by noticing how you're invested in looking and how you want to result from your looking. And it's in seeing that that starts to thin out just like the restlessness sends out by seeing it and becomes patience. Pure observation comes out of seeing how we're pushing objects around. We're trying to do something to them with awareness. Now if you don't do that, awareness is very powerful. It's a very subtle energy. And have any of you seen that? That it burns things up. Krishnamurti wrote a book. The title is called \u201cThe Flame of Awareness.\u201d It's a very good term for awareness; the more refined it becomes the more powerful it becomes. But it's not like you're trying to burn anything up. It's just the pure seeing. It has that effect. ","Break_line: Now if you can stick with it, sometimes what happens is you penetrate more deeply into boredom. And, often you'll find, that there are other things in there like aggression, anger. You'll see that the boredom is a mask. I'm not saying always, but I've certainly seen it sometimes. And if you penetrate once through the boredom and feel like there was something else cooking underneath there, and that the boredom was a way, a strategy, a way of managing it, so you don't have to get in touch with something that was much more frightening\u2013maybe fear, whatever it is. Suddenly you realize that boredom is a natural event. It's well worth looking at.

What if it\u2019s your own lifestyle that seems to be your old habits and lifestyle that tends to inhibit awareness? Our lifestyle is the not the same as it is here. ","Larry: I understand. ","Questioner: It\u2019s not appropriate for at home. ","Larry: Yes. Question: And yet, how do you know what is appropriate? ","Larry: Okay. One very beautiful application of this practice is to scrutinize what you're calling your lifestyle. And if we put it into the form of a question it would be: \u201cHow do we actually live?\u201d Underline actually. Not, how do you think you live? Or how you would like to live? Or how someone else would like you to live? But how do I actually live? And the only way you can find that out is by paying attention. How do I wake up? And how do I wake up? And how do I eat? We've been doing it here. How do I walk? And how do I do this? And you start to find out, not these ideals, not these images of our life. So we get back to that: about the difference between self-knowledge and self-images. ","Break_line: And so, you have to have a strong stomach sometimes when you start to see how you actually live. That is, we say one thing, we set all these goals in the morning for what we're going to accomplish. And then we don't do anything that would lead in that direction. I want to go to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but we buy tickets for Colorado. We're not going to get there. In our practice there's a term called \u201cclear comprehension of purpose,\u201d sati sampajanna. And that means awareness is very helpful there, in that if there's something that we're attempting to do. If we've set, \u201cthis is what we're attempting to do,\u201d awareness can help us see, are we doing that which actually leads to what we said we want to do? ","Break_line: You've been doing it in this retreat. Let's say you've set for yourself doing the walking meditation and you start to walk and suddenly the mind is out to lunch. It's all over. Well, there's something saying, \u201cNo, we decided we're going to do walking meditation. Oh, that's right. Okay.\u201d So then you come back. So, you're bringing into alignment what you say you're doing. You want to accomplish with what you're actually doing. Does it lead to it? And more and more you begin to see that. ","Break_line: Now, in terms of meditation, to give you a few examples, once you start to value awareness, let's say as the most precious thing there is: awareness. It's not just some little psychological faculty because, as it gets deeper, you'll see that you are awareness in the truest sense. If you're anything, you're awareness. And the Buddha is the fulfillment of awareness. Buddho: just pure knowing. Now, once you begin to respect that, let's say you begin to value a meditative living\u2013and we all do or we wouldn't be here\u2013but I mean really value it. You start to understand that it's as important as making it for lunch or other things that we never have doubts about. When you get home, you'll see that at least for most of us, we'll forget to sit, but we won't forget to go to breakfast or lunch or there are other things like that. ","Break_line: Now what if we begin to really, genuinely value a life of awareness? Then a lot of the things we do we begin to see, does this hamper the practice of meditation? Is it an impediment or does it enhance it? Let me give you the most obvious example that comes to mind. Let's say you eat, you begin to eat. And if you remember was suggested as you begin to pay attention as to how you eat, you may start to learn that certain foods contribute to the mind being more agitated, that hindrance, more restless. Other foods contribute to the mind being more dull and sleepy. That's another hindrance. These are some of the hindrances that Narayan talked about. And also the quantity, of course. If we eat a lot, we don't have any blood for our brain. It's all in the tummy. And then what happens? Well, we know what the sitting after lunch is like, right? All of us. So that now it is possible\u2013because many of us have done this\u2013to overeat, eat the wrong food, then sit down with the cushion, go like that, and then say \u201cI'm never going to overeat again. It's just awful. And terrible. I hate the feeling of being on the cushion, wasting my time here. The Buddha was an awakened one. Here am I sleeping.\u201d And then it comes time to eat again. And we start with you, we go through the same thing. Then we come back to the cushion. \u201cI'm never going to do this again because I see when I overeat and I get sleepy and I go this is not a meditative life. I'm not a good yogi and I'm just like\u201d... over and over and over. ","Break_line: Like, in my own case, I did that at an Indian restaurant. Narayan was witness to this. I don't know how long this took. Was it years? I don't know what. Yeah it would be something would go, something like this. We'd go in, we'd eat the food, it would taste good, and it would be with me for hours. I'd say, \u201cBoy, that food tastes good. But what you go through after, it's just not worth it.\u201d \u201cWant to go to an Indian restaurant?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d Finally, the day came like, \u201cI get it. Indian restaurant equals suffering for me.\u201d I have nothing against Indian rest. Okay. Now that's wisdom in action. That is, our practice is taking advantage of the law of cause and effect. It's really learning. It's just bringing intelligence into our life. It\u2019s seeing that when I do this, I get that, I suffer. When I don't do that, it seems, oh it's more reasonable. ","Break_line: Well, food is an obvious one but more and more you're going to begin to see other things. Now, the Buddha lists a few. For example, regarding the factors of enlightenment, these are qualities of mind that contribute very strongly to an awakened mind. And, in almost all of them, what he says is, for example, if you want to develop the quality of equanimity, hang out with people who are very relaxed and who are at peace, not with people who are all over the place and restless. If you want to, let's say, develop certain moral qualities like honesty, don't hang out with people who are lying, cheating, stealing, and killing all the time. Be with people who really are strong that way, whatever the quality is. And so you begin to see, it's humbling. You realize, I'm not Superman or Superwoman, and that it seems like the conditions that I'm in influence me a lot. So I'll do my best to be in conditions. I'm a young meditator. I'm just like a delicate little plant. I need protection. So I'm going to avoid situations that seem to destroy things. ","Break_line: Now, you have to be careful with that because you live in the world, and much of the time we can't control it. We have to be with who we have to be with. And so there we then have to learn about our reactions. And that's what I meant, the problem of living in a world of non-meditators. It's not really a joke. Most of the world is not going to meditate, ever. I feel pretty confident in that. They're just not going to. And, so that means that they're not going to investigate, they're not going to develop samadhi. They're not going to do any of the things that perhaps you're beginning to see as valuable. That means they're going to lose their temper immediately. They're going to be very possessive. They're going to be very grabby, all these things, and they can't help it. That's the normal. That's the way we all are. Aren't we that way now? Well, let's say, little by little, some of that thins out, but the world keeps rolling on. It keeps not meditating. ","Break_line: And so, if we set it up in such a way that we become so precious and so pure that the only people that we'll be with are those people who've done at least five three months retreats, only eat sprouts, do Tai Chi, and we won't even get on the same bus with anyone who's done\u2026 Well, it's going to be a little bit constrict, to use your expression, our lifestyle. Maybe one more and then.
